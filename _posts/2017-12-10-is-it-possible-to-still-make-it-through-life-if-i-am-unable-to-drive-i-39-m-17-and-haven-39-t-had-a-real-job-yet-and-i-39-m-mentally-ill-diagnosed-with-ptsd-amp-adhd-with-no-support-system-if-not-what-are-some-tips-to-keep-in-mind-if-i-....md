title: Is it possible to still make it through life if I am unable to drive? I&#39;m 17 and haven&#39;t had a real job yet, and I&#39;m mentally ill (diagnosed with PTSD &amp; ADHD) with no support system. If not, what are some tips to keep in mind if I&#39;m homeless?

<p>My main advice to you is to try not to think of your mental illness as any kind of barrier to getting what you want. You have challenges. Some of those challenges involve the way your mind works. You can observe yourself and come to an understanding of those challenges. You can devise strategies for dealing with them.</p><p>You need to be constantly pushing yourself towards better. This is as true when you have $0 to your name as it is when you have millions.</p><p>Youâ€™ll eventually find somewhere to land. Once you do, remember that you need to work with others and to let them help you if they want to. Trying to do it all yourself sucks.</p>
