<p>I rather enjoyed acting classes when I took them, and no, it’s no more difficult to create one emotion than any other. It may be more difficult for <i>you</i> to act out a particular emotion, I for one had problems at the time acting out being surprised.</p><p>But this is called <i>range</i> and it’s something you work on throughout your career.</p>
