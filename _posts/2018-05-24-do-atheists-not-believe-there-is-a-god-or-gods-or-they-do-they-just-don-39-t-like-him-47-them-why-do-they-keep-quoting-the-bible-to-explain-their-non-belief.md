title: Do atheists not believe there is a God or gods, or they do, they just don&#39;t like Him&#47;them? Why do they keep quoting the Bible to explain their non-belief?

<p>Atheists quote the Bible because that’s the language in which their discussion partners are fluent with. I love talking with atheists that know the Bible well enough to quote it because it gives us so much to work with. I can orient my arguments to first disproving the commonly-held belief that Abrahamic theology is fundamentally anti-humanistic and focused on blind obediance, then towards a fuller understanding of God’s plan in an allegorical sense.</p><p>Once the allegorical sense is in mind, I can start to dissect the fundamental disconnect atheists have with belief in this plan.</p>
