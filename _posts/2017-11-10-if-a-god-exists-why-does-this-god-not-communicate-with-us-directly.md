<p>He does. If you sit silently, turn your thoughts inward, and let them run out like a car running out of gas, then youâ€™ll hear the voice of God.</p><p>He speaks in an awesome, deafening silence. What does he say when he is saying nothing? <b>Everything</b>.</p><p>He sees everything, he understands everything. He forgives, embraces, cares. Everything.</p>
