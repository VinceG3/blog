title: What is the biggest age difference in a romantic relationship you would consider for yourself?

<p>I don’t date based on the age, I date based on attraction and logistics. I am unlikely to be attracted to anyone under 18, even though it would be legal for me to have relations all the day down to 16. (crazy Georgia laws)</p><p>Logistics, however make such a task virtually impossible, unless the parents make it abundantly clear that they’re okay with their daughter dating a 34 year old man. I can’t see myself ever approaching one so this would have to be a case of God Himself wanting us to be together so He strips away all the barriers and pushes us together. Because I ain’t trying to make it happen myself.</p>
