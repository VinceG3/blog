<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" data-qt-tooltip="squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a>. Used to be you could make a decent living making business websites for small clients. Those days are over. It takes too much time and effort and there’s virtually no profit potential. Plus you get clients coming back for years looking for maintenance and upgrades and they don’t want to pay you enough to make it worth it.</p><p>It’s so bad that I recommended my former company use SquareSpace for a marketing website even when they would have been perfectly willing to pay me because I just can’t be bothered anymore.</p><p>Just use SquareSpace.</p>
