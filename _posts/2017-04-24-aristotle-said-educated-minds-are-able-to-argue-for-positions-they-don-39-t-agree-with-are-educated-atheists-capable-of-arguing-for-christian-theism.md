<p>I think most atheists <i>think</i> they could, but ask them to actually do it and they wouldn’t be able to come up with good arguments. If they could then they wouldn’t be atheists and would instead be agnostic. Atheism implies certainty.</p><p>Atheists in general do not want to deal with spirituality. They just want to cut off that whole mode of thinking and only deal with things that they think make sense.</p>
