title: What first brought you to drug use?

<p>My father was an alcoholic and my mom threw him out when I was five. She smoked all while I was a kid. I wanted neither of those two things, but managed to take my first drink of alcohol due to, what else, peer pressure. The neighbors gave me a glass of rum and coke and, to their credit, didn’t try to pass it off as just soda. I think I finished the glass and ended up somewhat tipsy.</p><p>Still haven’t taken a single puff of burning tobacco. Tried weed once but didn’t care for it.</p><p>I have a strong distaste for drugs other than alcohol, particularly those that involve me sucking on burning plant material. I get quite disgusted by the smell of cannabis. For this reason only I am ambivalent rather than positive about legalization.</p><p>I tried ecstasy once, it was interesting. I’ve yet to try any psychedelic, though it is on my bucket list.</p><p>I have a firm rule for any friends that want to be a part of my life, if you’re not interesting enough to be around while you’re not high, you’re not going to be all that interesting when you are. Too many people try to fill the void in their lives with drug-fueled experience. It’s not as interesting as they think it is.</p>
