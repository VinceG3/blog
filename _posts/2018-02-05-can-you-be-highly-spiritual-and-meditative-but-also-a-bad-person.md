title: Can you be highly spiritual and meditative, but also a bad person?

<p>Tricky question because it's always easy to say someone isn't spiritual if they're also a bad person.</p><p>Ultimately what "bad person" means is subjective. We all have a certain inner guide that we can ignore that will make us bad, but the actual line is fuzzy and indistinct, and examining actual events and circumstances often offers the sobering realization that nothing is what it first seemed and the ethics and morals of a situation can't be easily pinned down to one person's fault.</p><p>That said, generally the sorts of people that get into doing bad things for bad reasons aren't going to be interested in spirituality, where if you're doing it right, you can't hide from yourself and your choices. Not just for that reason but also because spirituality requires work and you only have so much time in the day.</p>
