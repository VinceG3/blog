<p>Not really as useful as you might think. If you forget where you came from, then your new normal becomes your only normal. Meaning you haven’t really gone anywhere, and only substituted one set of problems for another.</p><p>Spiritual awakening doesn’t do what you think it does. You’re catapulted from one reality to another. The new reality is better, for sure, but your old reality was better than the one you entered that from.</p><p>Appreciation of history is essential to staying grounded.</p>
