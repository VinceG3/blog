<p>Make up an excuse for why you might be tired. Then change the subject.</p><p>I’ve noticed that this while this usually isn’t quite coded language, people never say this to you, whether you’re actually tired or not, when you look like a million bucks.</p><p>My last job was at a cosmetics marketing company, very image conscious. Fridays I liked to wear a suit. If you’ve never worn one before, it’s a skill. There are all kinds of little things you have to pay attention to if you want to do it right. Do it right and you look like a million bucks, even in a cheap suit.</p><p>I have <b>never</b> gotten the “you look tired” treatment when I was wearing one. I could have been nodding off in my chair, not giving a care to the world how my face looked, and all people saw was my suit. Body language that looks lazy in a polo and slacks looks relaxed and powerful in a suit.</p><p>For women, the same effect can be achieved with makeup. I think it’s particularly eye makeup that does the trick. It hides all the little subtleties of the musculature of the eyes and gives a bright neotenous effect. So if this happens to you a lot, that might be something to experiment with.</p>
