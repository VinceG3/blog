title: How should I let my boss know I am considering another job offer?

<p>You walk into your boss’s office, ask if you can close the door, then set the offer letter down on his desk.</p><p>The simple act of doing this demonstrates a good working relationship and trust. If you did not have those things, then instead of the offer which he can negotiate a counter for, he’ll get a two weeks notice.</p><p>At my first job in the industry, I gave a two weeks notice rather than a offer letter. The reason why was because the salary was $15k higher and I wouldn’t have kept my job if they matched it, which they couldn’t.</p><p>These days, I will ask for 48 hours consideration on all offers, then bring the offer to my current employer and we’ll talk it out. At the end of the meeting, we’ll shake hands, congratulate each other on our success, and stay friends no matter what happens.</p>
