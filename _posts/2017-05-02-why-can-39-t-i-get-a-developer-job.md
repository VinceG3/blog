<p>Just keep putting yourself out there. It can take quite a while to get established in the industry. Recruiters can help. So can Meetup groups. If you’re not going to one or more monthly Meetups, you’re really missing out.</p><p>You’re never going to be quite satisfied with your career. But if you keep pushing you’ll always be better off than where you’d be if you didn’t push. Learn to love the game. Interviews are fun. I’m reminded of acting class where they say the only real time you get to display your true acting self is in auditions, even if you get the role you’ll be constrained by the writing.</p>
