<p>Answering questions about attractiveness on Quora gets me in trouble, but I can’t help it.</p><p>I find Amber Rose to be absolutely delicious. It’s a combination of the shape of her body,</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5170db6d61a4884b76992cccf8e85c81.webp"><p>And the interestingness of her face.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f92e4bd9a3edcd02c854b6ca0ab01f73.webp"><p>But more than any of that is the personality she projects and embodies. This is a woman who, more than any other celebrity I’ve ever seen, owns herself and her life. She comes off as completely unafraid of anything.</p><p>Obviously I don’t know what she’s like in private, but that’s what attractiveness does for you. It makes you want to get to know the inner person. What’s hiding underneath that mask?</p><p>Another thing I get when looking at her, and I don’t know exactly why I get this feeling, is that she’d be an amazingly interesting and dynamic conversational partner, fluttering easily back and forth from the romantic to the intellectual, teasing with the sexual, but never letting my mind get too hung up on just how goddamn sexy she is. Again, just a feeling, but again, that’s what attractiveness is. The enticement that makes you want to dive in deep.</p>
