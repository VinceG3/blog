<p>No, that’s selfishness. Evil is what happens when you start to <i>love</i> selfishness. When you delight in causing pain and suffering to other people, when you enjoy treating them as objects.</p><p>The pathway to love involves <i>overcoming</i> obstacles, not submitting to them. It’s the same with evil. A person has to fight pretty hard to become evil. They have to work to develop their sociopathy, work to discard morals. When they’re done, they have become something that is very far from humanity.</p><p>Some life situations are perfect for cultivating evil, because the barriers and consequences are nonexistent. So it might be a path of least resistance for these people. But that’s actually pretty rare.</p>
