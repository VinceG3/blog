<p>No. Cheating is breaking the rules of a relationship. You can’t break the rules of a relationship that doesn’t exist.</p><p>You might be getting confused by someone having a bit of fun. Or by some crazy person whose imagining a relationship with you that doesn’t exist.</p><p>Either way I’d just laugh it off.</p>
