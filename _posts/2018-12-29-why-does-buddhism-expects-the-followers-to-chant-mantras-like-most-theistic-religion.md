<p>Because Buddhism is a religion. I don’t really understand why Westerners don’t want to realize this, but it is 100% a dyed-in-the-wool religion. You can go to Buddhist churches, I used to volunteer at one many moons ago.</p><p>Buddhism emerged from the same spiritual protoplasm as Hinduism. People misunderstand Hinduism, it’s not just one religion, it’s a way of unifying thousands of religions. Hinduism speaks of the same “four elements” that every other primitive religion deals with, air, water, wind and earth.</p><p>Buddhist writings use these to symbolically refer to ‘types’ of suffering. Many traditions hold that if you want to have deep understanding of Buddhism, you need deep understanding of how the four elements shape thought.</p><p>Buddhism can get very, very mystical. Trying to foist Western philosophical purity onto it can only diminish its beauty and make it harder for you to really get anything out of it. If you want philosophical purity, study philosophy.</p>
