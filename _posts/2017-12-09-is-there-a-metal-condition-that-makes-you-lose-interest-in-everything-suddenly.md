People with this condition typically, though not always, have long dreads and a long beard, and a faraway look in their eyes that comes from shredding faces the night before for 8 hours straight and not hitting the pillow until 6am. Yet there he is bringing your coffee at 10 in the morning.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-057f38f74695018fe41b52ea8ea0a9fc.webp"><p>Just try to mess with him. You’ll quickly find that he doesn’t give a fuck. He ran out of fucks years ago. He doesn’t even know what they look like anymore. If you fed him a fuck, he’d spit that shit out. All he cares about now is putting more pedals on his board to piss off the guitarist.</p>
