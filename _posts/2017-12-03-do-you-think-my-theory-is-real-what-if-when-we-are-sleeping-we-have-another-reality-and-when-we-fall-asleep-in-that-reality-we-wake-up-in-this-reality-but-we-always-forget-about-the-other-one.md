title: Do you think my theory is real? What if when we are sleeping, we have another reality, and when we fall asleep in that reality we wake up in this reality, but we always forget about the other one.

<p>The big problem with your approach is that the dream world isn’t real. By real I mean it doesn’t stick around and it doesn’t really have any good, solid rules. Things can be more or less real, and I’d rate people’s dream worlds as less real than the Star Wars universe.</p><p>Realities operate according to rules. We can very accurately describe how the physical world works, both in the macro and the micro. Those rules are completely independent of our minds. Dream worlds, on the other hand, are entirely dependent on our minds. Things that happened during the day can affect the structure and meaning of the dreams we have at night.</p><p>Nope, all signs point to the world of dreams being created entirely by the mind and having little to no external influence. Dreams can certainly be vehicles for exploration, but the thing your exploring is yourself.</p>
