title: I hate this, but nowadays there are lots of atheists that sway Christians and theists. I don&#39;t want to be swayed; I believe in God, but how do I ensure that my opinion stays that way? My apologies if this is confusing.

<p>I went the other way. I was an atheist who eventually learned how to believe.</p><p>Belief is a moving target. As soon as you get a good grip on it, it slips right out from your fingers and you have to go chase it again.</p><p>It’s the <i>willingness</i> to keep chasing belief that marks you a believer, not the actual state of your beliefs at any given point in time. Belief is a beautiful and fun thing to do. It creates profound, complex mental states that are just really really cool to experience.</p><p>I would suggest praying more. Actually sit down, in a quiet place, or kneel if that’s your fancy, and just look for God or Jesus in your head. He’ll answer if you call Him enough.</p>
