<p>This guy doesn’t. I’ve never responded much to compliments. In fact, compliments can turn me off, though I’m trying to work on that. This is because I’m a man of <b>action</b>.</p><p>If you want to stroke my ego, you need to get a feel for how guys like me view themselves. I see myself as a <i>sheathed weapon</i>. What I want you to do is take me out of my sheath and stab something. That’s what a weapon wants. <i>To be used</i>.</p><p>Complimenting a sword on the exquisiteness of its handle or the shininess of its blade isn’t going to win you any points with it. Get it dirty instead, that’s how it’s done.</p>
