<p>Nobody believes you should use the Bible as your <i>only</i> source of truth. Neuroscience is perfectly compatible with Christian morality and should not be ignored when forming your personal model for how the world works.</p><p>In this case, consciousness does not form all at once. The brain has to develop. You can go and look at babies and how their minds develop over time. The benefit of this is that you can then devise a method of child-rearing that is both best for the childâ€™s mental development and also best for the formation of morals.</p>
