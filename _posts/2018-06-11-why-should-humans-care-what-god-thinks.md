<p>Why should anyone care about how anyone thinks?</p><p>It’s because caring about how someone else thinks gives you access to a perspective that’s not your own. You don’t even have to be a theist to understand the utility of trying to appreciate the perspective of an imaginary God.</p><p>In fact, you can practicably <i>be</i> God in certain situations. There’s video games that give you the power of life and death over other characters, and these other characters can even be controlled by real people.</p><p>The game master in a game of Dungeons and Dragons is charged with providing the <i>exact same service</i> that God <b>in real life</b> is charged with providing you day to day.</p><p>You can play with the concepts of divinity in literary or in the concepts of a game, and in so doing, you’re <i>putting yourself in the mind of God</i>. This is quite a mystical thing to do, even if you feel it’s just imagination.</p><p>Mysticism is built on imagination.</p>
