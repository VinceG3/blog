<p>If you think about it, any ‘real’ afterlife constitutes reincarnation.</p><p>Existence needs to have meaning, otherwise consciousness cannot grow. The problem with realms like heaven or hell is that meaning is difficult to find there. The range of experiences you can have in the world’s defined afterlives are invariably extremely restricted, at least compared to this world.</p><p>When meaning cannot be found in existence, consciousness slowly grinds to a halt and ceases to operate. I believe that when this happens to you outside of the world, your ethereal mind falls apart and you get shunted along into the next life.</p><p>“Real” worlds, ones in which God’s guiding hand cannot be present, worlds in which things like terrorism, murder and rape are possible, are sure-fire meaning-creators. One can never fail to be able to find some kind of meaning to existence in a real world. Real worlds have endless possibilities for learning and growth. So many that you can live completely in the present all the time, being forced to find meaning in every single moment, and still never run out of it.</p>
