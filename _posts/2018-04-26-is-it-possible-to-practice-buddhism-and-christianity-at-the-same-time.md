<p>There is no shame or problem in picking and choosing the aspects of spirituality to believe in. If you knew the history of how the religious sausage is made, you wouldn’t feel bad at all about it.</p><p>Religion is socialized spirituality. It’s hard to socialize something when everybody believes different things. So as a result ecumenical councils tend to take on the air of laying down the law. There was no nuance, no real room for debate, in the first council of Nicaea. It was convened by the Roman emperor and all decisions had to please him.</p><p>Buddhist councils were similar: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_councils" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Buddhist councils - Wikipedia</a></p><p>Religions serve political purposes as well as spiritual ones. What does God want? He wants you to use your brain.</p>
