<p>Try <a href="http://www.htdp.org/" data-qt-tooltip="htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a></p><p>I went through this book about 5 or so years ago and it changed the way I thought about programs. It gave me a proper appreciation for data and the functional approach. I use object orientation nowadays at my day job but it never hurts to learn how the other side of the coin works.</p>
