title: What is the significance of impermanence in Buddhism?

<p>Buddhism teaches that there are three characteristics of reality. Suffering, impermanence, and no-self. Each of these is a gateway to enlightenment.</p><p>But if you ask me, impermanence is Buddhism’s entire schtick. It stands reign above suffering and no-self as the characteristic that really gives Buddhism its meaning. Because once you reach a certain level of consciousness, suffering goes away, and no-self is just a semantic trick they play.</p><p>But impermanence? That’s really and truly worthy of building a worldview and religion on top of. Literally nothing in existence <b>stays there</b>, it eventually <i>stops existing</i>. Nothing is permanent, everything goes away eventually. If you stick with that, it’ll take you all the way to enlightenment and beyond.</p>
