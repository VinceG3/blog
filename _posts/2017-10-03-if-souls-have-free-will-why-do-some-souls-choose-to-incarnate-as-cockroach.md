title: If souls have free will, why do some souls choose to incarnate as cockroach?

<p>My current working answer to this question is twofold. First, that souls do not in fact, have free will. You need to be incarnated for free will to make sense. So you don’t choose your next body, it’s chosen for you.</p><p>Second, consciousnesses grows in size and no human consciousness could fit in the body of a cockroach. A human-sized consciousness in a cockroach body would feel like he was having a dream of being a cockroach, as only part of his consciousness could extend out into the body of the roach. The rest of it would remain unmanifested.</p><p>A similar mechanism is behind spiritual awakening. Normal mundane life stops being meaningful to a person, so they seek out interconnectedness. In a sense, their consciousness is expanding outside of their body.</p><p>It makes more sense when you think of consciousness as abstract rather than actually being a brain. Even if your brain is on Earth, your mind can be on the Moon. You just have to visualize it.</p>
