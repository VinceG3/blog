<p>It’s <b>a</b> coping mechanism, as such it’s better than not coping at all, but I wouldn’t exactly call it a good one.</p><p>Fetishes tend to drive mating behavior, that’s why we call them fetishes. It places willingness to fulfill the fetish over everything else about the person. And in particular if someone is willing to fulfill a humiliation fetish for you, and you date them for that reason, then they may be getting off on the power of manipulating you rather than on mutual attraction, respect, or understanding.</p><p>It’s unlikely to make for a good relationship.</p><p>I’d suggest finding a better way to cope. You can shore up your self esteem lots of different ways. Get good at something. Try to change parts of yourself that you don’t like. Strive harder to succeed.</p>
