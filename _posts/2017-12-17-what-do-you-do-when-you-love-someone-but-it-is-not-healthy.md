title: What do you do when you love someone but it is not healthy?

<p>Take a good hard look at yourself and ask why you are so invested in an unhealthy relationship.</p><p>I like to go through an exercise of <i>enumerating</i> the things you need in order to be happy with the relationship. That means to list them down on a sheet of paper, one after another. Then you need to think pretty hard about it, why do you need those things, and what would make you satisfied enough that you have it that you can cross it off your list.</p><p>One thing that tends to happen as you do this is you just start to realize that there’s no way they could ever be what you need them to be. Once you have this realization, it’s just a matter of time before you can untangle your emotions from the relationship. You’ll stop holding on and start craving new kinds of experiences.</p>
