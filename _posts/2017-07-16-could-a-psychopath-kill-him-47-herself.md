title: Could a psychopath kill him&#47;herself?
date: 2017-07-16

<p>I’ll defer to the real psychopaths on Quora if they contradict me, but I would say no. Not only are they not prone to existential angst, it also wouldn’t occur to them to solve any problem at all, much less a philosophical one, through self-harm. Self-harm is pretty much the complete polar opposite of anything a psychopathic mind would come up with.</p>
