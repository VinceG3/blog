<p>Your ascertainment of her sexiness should play no role in your decision to hire her. In fact, if you doubt your ability to act objectively in this case, you should hand the decision to someone else in the organization.</p><p>To act otherwise is unprofessional and potentially harmful to your organization. She may pick up on the attraction and use it to influence you in ways you wouldnâ€™t be susceptible to otherwise.</p>
