title: If I was the devil and this was hell, would you like me to come out and talk to you? I love my little sinners.

<p>Would I! It’s the whole reason why I went to hell in the first place! Who is this weird crazy fellow who participates in God’s vision by helping all the dirty little sinners atone? What stories does he have to tell? How does he see himself and his work? What does it take to get past his shell? Eternity? How many eternities?</p><p>I certainly don’t need any of this self flagellation business myself. Nope, I’d be all about satisfying my bottomless curiosity. It’d be worth any amount of crispy roasting.</p><p>Winston Churchill once said, “if you find yourself in hell, keep moving,” but he didn’t say I had to do so right away!</p>
