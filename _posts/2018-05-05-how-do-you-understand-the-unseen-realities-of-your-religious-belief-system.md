<p>Through mysticism.</p><p>It starts with pure meditation / prayer. Focus the mind on some subject and practice your concentration. Eventually your mind will acclimate to the experience of turning inwards and the task will no longer feel like a chore.</p><p>Once you achieve stillness, your next task is to fill it with something. Hold a question about one of these unseen realities in your mind while you are still. Your mind will conjure up insight into that reality.</p><p>So perhaps you'd like to meet Jesus. After you are still, ask Jesus to come say hi. You will feel something. Explore that feeling. It takes a while to attune the mind to a spiritual frequency. Take your time and let it come.</p>
