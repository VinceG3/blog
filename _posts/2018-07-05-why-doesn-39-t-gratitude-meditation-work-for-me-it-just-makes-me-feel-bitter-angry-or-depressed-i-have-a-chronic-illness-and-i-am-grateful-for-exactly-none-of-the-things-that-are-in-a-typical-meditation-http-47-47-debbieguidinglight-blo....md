title: Why doesn&#39;t gratitude meditation work for me? It just makes me feel bitter, angry, or depressed. I have a chronic illness and I am grateful for exactly none of the things that are in a typical meditation.

<p>Meditation is a bit like memorization, you’re building neural pathways in your mind. The more you do it, the easier it gets. Gratitude in particular is is something you can spend a lifetime doing and still not ever feel like you’ve mastered it. Kinda like Zen in that regard.</p><p>Find something you are grateful about and start with that. Even if it’s just “I’m glad I got through the day without tripping and falling on my face.” Your skeptical mind might complain, but the deeper part of your mind, the one you’re trying to train with meditation, will take to it with enough repetition.</p><p>You just have to put in the work.</p>
