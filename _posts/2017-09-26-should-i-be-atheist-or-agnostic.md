title: Should I be atheist or agnostic?

<p>Don’t ask what you should be. Ask yourself what the appropriate label for your beliefs is. If you believe that God doesn’t exist, then call yourself an atheist because that helps people better understand what goes through your head. (cue angry atheists telling me that atheism isn’t a belief) If you aren’t sure what to believe, and it sounds like this is the case, then call yourself agnostic until you firm up your beliefs more.</p><p>The world is long past the days where it’s appropriate to apply “should” to something as intimate and personal as your beliefs. As well ask whether you should be gay or not.</p>
