title: Why did God give mankind free will only to then kill most of them in a flood for not doing things his way?

<p>God killing people is not the same thing as you or I killing people. God has the benefit of omniscience, which allows him to determine what is just, and omnipotence, which allows him to determine exactly how His plans are carried out.</p><p>God can end people’s lives in various ways. I was moved to tears recently when I saw that a wonderful mathematician and his wife died together in a car accident. Personally, I can’t think of many better ways to go. Dying with your spouse is a great luxury, nobody has to spend any time grieving as a widow. and dying without an extended period of time under control of the medical establishment is yet another rare but delightful happenstance.</p><p>God can also reward the deserving in the world after, people losing their lives in this world need not be considered a great loss. Naturally only those who believe in an afterlife or try to live in a particularly spiritual way will see things this way.</p><p>So God wiping the slate clean and restarting is more scary than it needs to be.</p>
