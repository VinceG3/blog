<p>Mysticism is not something <i>to</i> believe in, it’s something you do <i>in order</i> to believe. It’s a process, a method, not an end goal.</p><p>When you cultivate stillness of mind, and combine that with spiritual ideas, then while you’re practicing, the mind will naturally start to recombine ideas and apply them to, well, whatever you have going on. It’s the mind’s way of coming up with reasonable solutions to problems without having to ask someone else.</p><p>In the process, belief in that avenue of looking into yourself is strengthened. This is mysticism. Looking into yourself and then reaching out for new insights or experiences. All it takes is imagination and a willingness to be humble. If you have a good moral upbringing, then you really can’t go wrong.</p><p>It looks hokey and stupid to materialists, but it solves real problems that people really have.</p>
