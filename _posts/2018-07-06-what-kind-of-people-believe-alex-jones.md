title: What kind of people believe Alex Jones?

<p>I think very few people actually believe his crap 100%. I've listened to enough of it to where I can conclude that it's 70% entertainment. People want to believe in it because it makes them feel good and relevant. The explanations are simple enough to grasp but outlandish enough that the people that are entertained by it feel they're part of a special club, Jones even has a name for it, the InfoWar.</p><p>They're sound bites made for sharing, tailored to appeal to people who want to think of themselves as intellectuals but just don't have the time or the inclination for real study.</p><p>Would they march off a bridge if Alex Jones asks them to? No. But that's the brilliance of Alex Jones, he'd never do that. Jones is so keyed into his audience that he wouldn't have to ask.</p><p>No, the left really should be asking themselves how they could let this gold mine go untapped for so long.</p>
