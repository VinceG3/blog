<p>It’s not love at first, it’s just attraction. Attraction leads to interaction, which leads to fascination, which leads to friendship, which intertwines with romance, which finally deepens into love.</p><p>You seem to making the common mistake of confusing fascination for love and want to skip the friendship and romance parts.
