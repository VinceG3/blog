<p>Start with just one field. Multi-disciplinary experts are certainly valuable, but you need to know what the marketplace is looking for, and you need to get into that marketplace before you can know what they want.</p><p>Everything should be focused on getting you that first job. Once you have it, you need to pay your dues and get established. Only when youâ€™re established in your field can you start to chart your own course. You have to work on a pirate ship and learn how they work before you can command one.</p>
