title: If the universe has a creator what evidence do you have to link him to your specific religion? What evidence do you have that makes him the god of your religion and not that of other religions? What if we have no idea of who he really is?

<p>We thought of that already. It’s kinda the whole point behind monotheism. All deities are but aspects of one God, the Source of all things.</p><p>The personage of God isn’t terribly important. The expression is “God is all things to all people.” He was the jealous and vindictive sky-father that pre-medieval Hebrews craved, and the gentle and caring son that captivated the Romans. He’s all faces of Shiva, and the essence of the Buddha.</p><p>Sure, some <i>people</i> get dogmatic about their favorite aspect of God, but the more mature believers are prepared to accept and work in other faiths as valid ways to worship Him. Mature Buddhists understand and appreciate Christianity, and some may even grant that Christ may have been enlightened, though of course it’s impossible to know for sure.</p>
