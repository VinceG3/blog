<p>If you <b>can’t</b> trust your therapist enough to tell them about it, then you need a new therapist.</p><p>The therapeutic relationship is one of mutual trust and understanding. You literally can <i>not</i> make any progress on therapeutic goals if this isn’t there.</p><p>What I would do is to share a lot of stuff that’s not the super-dangerous thing, make sure you have a real connection with them.</p><p>Once you have that, then you need to open up about it. If you can’t, then you’re just wasting your time there and need to either find a new therapist or a new way of working on yourself.</p>
