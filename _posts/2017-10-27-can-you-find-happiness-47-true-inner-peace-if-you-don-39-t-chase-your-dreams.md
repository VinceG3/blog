<p>Everybody’s different. If you don’t have any dreams to chase, then you’re not going to get much out of conjuring them up.</p><p>People often greatly misinterpret this kind of advice. Chasing your dreams does not have to involve busting your behind for years trying to break into some rarefied social clime, like the entertainment business.</p><p>It could also mean you dream of a quiet life away from it all. Chasing your dreams might involve working hard to be able to afford to buy a place out there with no mortgage, just cash.</p><p>You decide what you want out of life. Fulfillment is having a life that you get more meaning out of than you thought you were going to get.</p>
