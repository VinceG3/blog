title: My girlfriend asks me all the time &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; It&#39;s gotten to the point where I have asked her to stop asking me. Is it wrong to tell her that, if I want to share what I&#39;m thinking I will tell her?

<p>You need to learn how to just talk to your girl. I’m embarrassed to say this, but it took me like four years after I started regularly interacting with a lady before I could get the trick of just talking to her.</p><p>It’s just not right to wait until you want to share. Not only is it rude, but that kind of kills the whole purpose of having a boy/girlfriend. You have what you want from her, you should be willing to give her what she wants. And what she wants is to talk to the guy she likes so much.</p><p>So stop treating her like furniture and start coming up with stuff to say and talk about.</p>
