<p>I know because I talk to God. He tells me everything I need to know about religion. Religions are great. All of them. You can learn no matter which one you decide to work with.</p><p>The <b>best</b> one to go with is the one your parents are. Because those are the values and cultures and traditions you grew up with. You’re going to be able to relate to it better. If you want to play around with Buddhism or whatever, God’s not going to be jealous. Sure, He talks about being jealous in the Old Testament. Those people were prone to wickedness if they didn’t stay on the straight and narrow. Read Sodom and Gomorrah if you want to see what God was up against. God’s not worried that you’re going to rape strangers if you meditate like a Buddhist.</p><p>Religion is just one way to glorify God. God doesn’t care <i>how</i> you glorify Him, He just thinks it’s better for you if you do.</p>
