<p>The attitudes of other atheists.</p><p>I was 15 when I decided I was an atheist. Religion seemed silly and stupid to me, who in the world would let themselves get deluded by that stuff? I had found the Internet and darn it if it didnâ€™t seem like all the smart people of the world were there.</p><p>But man were they angry. And arrogant. The rants I read from my fellow atheists. It was enough to plant a seed of doubt, but I still had no idea what to replace my disillusioned atheism with. Not every atheist I met was like this, but enough to make me examine exactly what it was about it that I got out of it.</p>
