title: What other alternatives are there to the idea of a single reality?

<p>Reality for each individual person, very weakly united by a shared physical reality. This is what I subscribe to. My definition of reality is “an environment and set of rules that persist.” If you think past people’s immediate physical reality you have abstractions like school, work, people’s social lives. These things form the person’s reality, and may be shared with others, but their experience of this reality is theirs and theirs alone.</p><p>There is also a person’s inner mental life, which generally follows certain patterns. These patterns form the ultimate foundation of people’s realities. An insecure guy’s reality may include concepts like being an incel. Being a stupid reality doesn’t make it any less real to them.</p><p>When you think about it, objective physical reality is only like 2% of the reality that people experience.</p>
