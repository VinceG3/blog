title: What distinguishes morals from ethics with regard to religion?
date: 2019-01-08

<p>There’s nothing really different about the religious conception of ethics / morals rather than the “normal” conception of them. People vary on their beliefs of where morality comes from, but ethics is a kind of <i>rational</i> morality. While morality is traditionally held to be eternal and unchanging, ethics sprout up according to the domain they’re created for.</p><p>Morality says it’s wrong to cheat someone in a business transaction, ethics comprise exactly what constitutes cheating. Ethics can change over time as society comes to different realizations. Or they could be different across jurisdictions. What’s ethical in North Carolina might not be so in Texas.</p>
