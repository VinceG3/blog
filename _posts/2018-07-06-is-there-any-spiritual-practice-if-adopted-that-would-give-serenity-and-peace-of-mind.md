<p>All of them. In fact, you can divide spiritual practices into two criteria, those that give serenity and peace of mind when you do them properly, and those that aren't actually spiritual.</p><p>The key prerequisite that all of them share is the ability to open your heart to the transcendent. If you can do that, you're well on your way to making any practice work for you.</p>
