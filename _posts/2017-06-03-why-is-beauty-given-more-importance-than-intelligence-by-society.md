<p>What makes you think it is?</p><p>The ultimate measure of social importance is how much society will pay you for it. Beautiful people will gain an advantage in certain jobs, but those jobs have fairly strict earning ceilings, and are mostly just considered by those in the know as vehicles to find a spouse by.</p><p>Being sexy will not increase your candidacy for a CEO role, or any technical role.</p><p>Beauty is treated by society as any other marketable trait. Smart, attractive people learn how to market it, but most people with beauty just get taken advantage of.</p>
