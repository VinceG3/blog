title: I&#39;ve met a Lady who I&#39;m not physically attracted to. We get on otherwise and have plenty in common. I just don&#39;t feel it. Why should looks matter?

<p>It matters because you’re eventually going to find yourself in an intimate moment with them, and you don’t want the festivities to feel forced.</p><p>There is a word for people we love spending time with but aren’t interested in sex or intimacy with. It’s called “friend.” Be her friend and don’t ask for anything more. If she’s romantically inclined towards you, she’ll get over it, and learn to value the friendship.</p><p>Nothing good comes out of trying to force romance / intimacy.</p>
