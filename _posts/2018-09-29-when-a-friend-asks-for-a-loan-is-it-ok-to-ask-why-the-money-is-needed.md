<p>Yes. Always ask. You’re setting yourself up to be treated like an ATM if you don’t.</p><p>A loan from a friend should be part of an act of repentance. They couldn’t make it work under their own steam, there’s a reason why they couldn’t make it work, you need to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem.</p><p>Asking them why, making them own up to the sequence of events that led to them asking you for your hard-earned money, is necessary to that process.</p><p>If a beggar asks me for money, I don’t bother asking him what he’s going to use it for, and I don’t really care. If you’re at the point where you’re asking strangers for money, you’re far far beyond the point where a friend can help you.</p><p>But if you can talk it out with a friend, then maybe you can come up with a solution together for their problem.</p>
