<p>Go to the coffee shop and chat up anyone you see that seems open to chatting with you. That’s how I did it.</p><p>Have lots of conversations with people you <i>aren’t</i> romantically interested in also, don’t just beeline for the ladies. They’ll smell the desperation on you like cheap cologne.</p><p>I’m not gonna lie, it takes a <b>long</b> time to develop those kinds of social skills. But you should take heart, finding casual relationships these days is way easier than finding serious ones.</p>
