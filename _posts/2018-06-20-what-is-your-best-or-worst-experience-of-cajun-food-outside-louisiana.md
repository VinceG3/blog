<p>In Atlanta there’s a plethora of “Cajun” restaurants serving mostly New Orleans style cuisine, more respect is given to the ones that just call their food New Orleans-style rather than Cajun, but one that took the cake was this place that thought étoufée was made with a can of brown gravy, just like you’d get from the grocery store, dump a few warmed-from-frozen crawfish on the top of it and slap it over a bed of rice. No seasoning in sight, truly horrendous.</p>
