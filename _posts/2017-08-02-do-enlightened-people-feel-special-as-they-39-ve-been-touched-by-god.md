title: Do enlightened people feel special, as they&#39;ve been touched by god?

<p>I personally do. Just about all the time.</p><p>I call this property “blessed.” When you’re blessed, nothing ever really goes wrong for you. Things that typically turn out really bad for others, just kind of fizzle out whenever you’re involved.</p><p>I was born lower middle class. My father was an abusive alcoholic. My mom got stalked and abused by strangers. Yet she managed to find a military guy to marry and got us out of that situation. When I was in my early twenties I went to go live with him. Over the years I built a good working relationship with him.</p><p>I’ve always been rather lazy, but I’ve never had to work really hard to make money. Things just go my way when it counts. If I want something, the universe works out a way to get it for me. And makes a fun adventure out of it for me to explore. Nothing ever really goes wrong in my life.</p><p>The way I have it worked out is, most people need a certain amount of strife in their lives in order to grow and feel like they’ve accomplished something. I need no such thing, so none appears in my life. I would never take anybody seriously who claimed enlightenment who didn’t at least have this same ‘blessed’ quality.</p>
