<p>You have two categories of attraction here. <i>Instant</i> attraction and <i>ongoing</i> attraction. Instant attraction is caused both by all the things you’d expect, such as money and looks, but also by way subtler things like genetic differences and psychology.</p><p>Ongoing attraction is where you get the most bang for your buck and I describe it my blog post <a href="https://vinceguidry.quora.com/Guy-%E2%80%9CLeagues%E2%80%9D">Guy “Leagues”</a>. Strong ongoing attractive traits can easily override a lack of instant traits.</p>
