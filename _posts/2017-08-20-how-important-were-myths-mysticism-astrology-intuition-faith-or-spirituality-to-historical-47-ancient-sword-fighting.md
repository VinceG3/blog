<p>This was pretty interesting:</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_of_Thales" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Eclipse of Thales - Wikipedia</a></p><p>I would imagine intuition played a big role in hand-to-hand combat. Even today you hear stories of soldiers managing to survive based on following sudden hunches. The mind takes in and processes way more information than you ever could consciously.</p><p>Spirituality, myth, mysticism, and the like are vehicles for the mind to present such information to you consciously. So it’s quite conceivable that someone going through a ‘dark night of the soul’ might get worse as a warrior because he’s not firing on all cylinders.</p>
