<p>I’d say Samuel, and if I had to pick between the two, probably the second book, of the story of David’s kingdom.</p><p>David is a phenomenal example of how a man should act. Nobody can live up to Jesus, but David’s flaws make him a far more relatable character. It tells of how a man should approach his relationship with God, and had me nodding right along at the events of the narrative. He displayed temperance, wisdom, and forbearance in spades. His devotion to and faith in God never wavered.</p><p>When his chickens came home to roost in the last few chapters, he didn’t try to weasel his way out of it and accepted not just the responsibility to atone for his sins, but also the sins of his predecessor, Saul. Samuel is the Bible at its best, in my opinion.</p>
