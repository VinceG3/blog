title: What is your biggest question of all?

<p>The biggest question I know of has to do with evolution. At what scale is evolution currently happening? The two basic approaches I have for dealing with this are: What we’re seeing is what’s happening. This is the first big bang and everything we see is what it is.</p><p>The other approach is way more interesting. That this is not the first big bang, and this is just one step on the road. Countless things all evolve in parallel.</p><p>Evolution finds ‘set points’. An example of a set point is the laws that matter operate by. Certain constants exist in the universe, like how strong gravity is. That’s an example of a physical set point, another one might be the Internet. Certain things are inevitable given the right environment, and self-direction tends to make everything trend towards those environments.</p><p>What, exactly, is the scale that evolution currently acts on? An answer to this question would affect literally everything. Whether things like souls exist and what their nature is.</p>
