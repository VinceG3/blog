<p>I’d say it’s time to find another job.</p><p>What I see happening here is the company is starting to take you for granted. You’re doing your job, without a fuss, just trying to be helpful. Unfortunately, all that’s going to lead to is a long, boring career for just one company, which is going to get rich and you’re just going to be left with nothing.</p><p>You need to start recognizing this kind of behavior, because once it starts, it’s only going to get worse.</p><p>Moving to another company isn’t going to guarantee that it won’t happen again, but it’s really the only option you have to preserve your own autonomy. The longer you stay, the more ossified you’re going to get career-wise.</p><p>Start interviewing. Don’t just take any job, make sure yours is an upward move, you’re getting more salary, benefits, whatever.</p><p>Whatever you do, don’t let on that you’re looking for a new job. You cannot trust your employer to take that news philosophically. They’ll turn the screws any way they can.</p><p>It might not be the next job, or the next, but eventually you’ll find a job where your talents are actually valued, both with respect and with compensation. You just need to keep moving until you find it.</p>
