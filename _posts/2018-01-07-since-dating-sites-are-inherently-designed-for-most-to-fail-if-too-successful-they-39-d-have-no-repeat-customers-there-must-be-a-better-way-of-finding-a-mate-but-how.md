title: Since dating sites are inherently designed for most to fail (if too successful, they&#39;d have no repeat customers!), there must be a better way of finding a mate, but how?

<p>Personally, I like just meeting the people around you, dating them, learning what works and what doesn’t work, so that eventually you have a relationship that lasts.</p><p>Of course, if you’re super-skittish about asking people out then you’re going to find that difficult. The thing is, you can’t be skittish if you want to take charge of your dating life. You need to find it in you to communicate to the people you’re interested in dating that you’re interested in them. Some of them will be responsive, some of them won’t be. You can’t take it personally if they aren’t.</p>
