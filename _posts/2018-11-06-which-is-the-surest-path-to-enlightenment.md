title: Which is the surest path to enlightenment?

<p>Probably through Buddhist dharma. My book recommendation on the subject is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005TQU7P8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" data-qt-tooltip="amazon.com">Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha</a> by Daniel Ingram. He gives a rational, lucid take on the subject that is hard to find elsewhere.</p><p>If you can’t bring rationality to the table, then directness is out of the question. If you also cannot actually follow the rational path, then directness is, again, off the table. You’ll forever be finding your way out of one hall of mirrors or another. It’ll still eventually make you enlightened, but certainly not in this lifetime.</p>
