title: How good is America really doing under Trump?

<p>America is better <i>despite</i> Trump.</p><p>We have a fascinating social system, when you start to look at it compared to other places around the world. We don’t frequently have ineffective leaders, but when we do, it doesn’t hurt much of anything. Our economic and political systems have an inertia that our elected leaders can either add momentum to or maybe leach a little from.</p><p>Americans might not have a lot of faith in our elected leadership, but we do have an unshakable faith in the ability for our <i>system</i> to drive ultimately-good outcomes regardless. Problems will be noticed and fixed, not left to fester and grow. Trump’s election provoked a national conversation about sexism and we’re better off for it.</p>
