<p>The long and short of it is that they were written by different people. The Old Testament is a collection of ancient stories that were originally passed through word of mouth. They’ve been collected into various religious texts including the Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Torah. The stories in the Old Testament were already hundreds of years old when Jesus was born.</p><p>After Jesus died, the aftermath and the rise of Christendom saw the creation of a new Scripture, taking the old stories and setting them into a new, larger story that focused not just on God’s chosen people, but on God’s plan for all of mankind.</p><p>Jews rejected Jesus as a prophet, or at least as an anointed figure on par with David, so they did not incorporate the gospels and their attendant narrative expositions, like <i>Revelation</i>, into their religion.</p>
