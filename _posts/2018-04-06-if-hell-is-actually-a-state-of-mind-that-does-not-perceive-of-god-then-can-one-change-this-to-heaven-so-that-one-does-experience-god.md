title: If Hell is actually a state of mind that does not perceive of God, then can one change this to Heaven so that one does experience God?

<p>In order to perceive God, you must develop the capacity to believe in him. To develop the capacity to believe in him, you must first suspend your disbelief of God long to have a mystical experience confirming his existence to you.</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to go to a church and ask your pastor for help praying.</p>
