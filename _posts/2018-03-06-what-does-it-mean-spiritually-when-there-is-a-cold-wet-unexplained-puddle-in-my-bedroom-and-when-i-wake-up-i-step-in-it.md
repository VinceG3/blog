title: What does it mean spiritually when there is a cold wet unexplained puddle in my bedroom and when I wake up I step in it?

<p>Don’t look for spiritual explanations until you’ve ruled out the mundane.</p><p>This becomes essential as you start integrating spirituality deeper in your life and start talking with spirit guides and such. When I was doing it, every now and again, just to keep me on my toes, my guide would mess with me. One time I let my spirit guide give me directions rather than use a GPS. Predictably, I got lost. Just when I was about to pull out my phone, I found the main road, I was almost exactly where I’d started.</p><p>Find out what’s in the puddle, water, urine, soft drink. That should give you an immediate clue where to look next.</p>
