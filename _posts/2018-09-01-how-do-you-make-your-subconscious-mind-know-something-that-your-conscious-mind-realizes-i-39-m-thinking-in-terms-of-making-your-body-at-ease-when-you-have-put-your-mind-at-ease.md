<p>Subconscious-conscious harmony is achieved once you have the realization that your subconscious needs to be validated and accepted rather than bulldozed over. You need to work together, not fight like step-siblings.</p><p>In this specific instance, you merely think your mind is at ease. The reality is, youâ€™ve bulldozed acceptance onto your mind and your subconscious is rebelling hard. The reason why your subconscious is rebelling is the same reason you had to bulldoze acceptance onto it.</p><p>The answer is to recognize what the subconscious is digging its heels in about, and coming up with an acceptable approach to dealing with the conflict.</p>
