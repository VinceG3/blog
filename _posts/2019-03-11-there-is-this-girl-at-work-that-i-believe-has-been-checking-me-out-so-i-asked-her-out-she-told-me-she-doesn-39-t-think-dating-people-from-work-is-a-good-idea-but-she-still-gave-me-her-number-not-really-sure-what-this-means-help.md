title: There is this girl at work that I believe has been checking me out so I asked her out. She told me she doesn&#39;t think dating people from work is a good idea, but she still gave me her number. Not really sure what this means. Help?

<p>Call her twice a week. Just talk about stuff. Don’t ask her out again. What you’re waiting for is for her to start calling you or to suggest a next step, like a dinner.</p><p>If she starts calling you then trade off on who calls who unless you find she’s always calling you. If this starts happening then ask her out.</p><p>I didn’t learn until my thirties just what a treasure it is to be able to call someone you’re interested in regularly. Don’t look that gift horse in the mouth.</p>
