title: How do I approach a girl on train?

<p>Nowadays whenever I see a cute girl sitting by herself on the train, I don’t hesitate. I move in, and sit right down next to her.</p><p>Get this next part, it’s genius. I sit right down next to her, and then I do <i>absolutely nothing</i>. I don’t take off my headphones. I pull out my phone and play Threes. I totally ignore her, like she wasn’t even there.</p><p>What happens next, I hear you asking. Well, nothing. I become the wall between her and every other guy who wants to talk to her. She gets a little bit of peace to start her day with. I pointedly ignore the crap out of her if we happen to get off at the same stop. If she wants to get off before me, I move without saying a word.</p><p>When I don’t do this, invariably some idiot will take his shot. Once that happens, she’s stuck with him until he gives up, because guys are idiots and can’t take a hint. And I get to kick myself for not just manning up.</p><p>Look, do you really want to try to talk to someone when there’s a 95% chance that she’s got <b>zero</b> interest in talking to you? I’ve been riding the train now for two years. She don’t want to talk to <i>no one</i>. If you do, it’s going to get <i>awkward</i>. Fast.</p><p>Don’t do it.</p>
