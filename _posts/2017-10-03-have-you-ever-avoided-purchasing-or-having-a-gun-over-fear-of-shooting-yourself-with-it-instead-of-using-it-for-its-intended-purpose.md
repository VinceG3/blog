title: Have you ever avoided purchasing or having a gun over fear of shooting yourself with it instead of using it for its intended purpose?

<p>Guns <i>introduce</i> danger to households, not reduce it. You’re far more likely to have an accident than you are to ever use it to successfully defend yourself. It’s basic, incontrovertible math. Doesn’t matter how many gun safety courses you take, doesn’t matter whether you own a gun safe or not. All safety measures fail with far greater frequency than home invasions.</p><p>There are vanishingly few situations where keeping a gun is a better option than <i>removing yourself from the source of danger that you’re hoping to mitigate</i>.</p><p>Still, guns aren’t particularly dangerous (compared to getting in your car everyday) when you take the appropriate safety measures. So I’m not saying you’re a moron for having one if that’s what you want to do. But you are quite foolish if you think it’s making you <b>safer</b>.</p><p>Get a gun because you like shooting, not because you want to shoot someone.</p>
