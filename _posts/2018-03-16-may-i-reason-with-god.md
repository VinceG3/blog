title: May I reason with God?

<p>It's difficult. God does not respond well to reason because God's purpose is to help us see past our own minds. So trying to reason with him winds up being like reasoning with a mischievous genie. When he plays ball, you'll get what you said you wanted. But not what you actually wanted.</p><p>That said, systems of magick purport to bring the power of spirit under conscious control. So long as you obey the rules and don't try to bite off more than you can chew, it can work for you. The rules are legion, however, and are pretty much designed to, again, not give you what you really want. If you want something to Google, intention-manifestation is a term for a modern system of magick you can learn.</p><p>But overall, it's not a great idea. The Christians don't get a whole lot right, but prayer really is the best approach. Learn to pray. Few things offer more value in life.</p>
