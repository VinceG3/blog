<p>Demonology as a concept almost universally relies on a good-evil framework, which itself typically entails deities as well. So very probably not.</p><p>Belief in communication with the dead is going to mostly hinge on materialism, not atheism. You can be an atheist without being a materialist, but you can’t be a materialist without also being an atheist, at least not without doing some pretty crazy mental gymnastics.</p><p>I’m not aware of any plausible statistics or even estimations of how many atheists are materialists. I used to think most Western atheists are also materialists, but I’ve recently had interactions with some that really made me question that conviction.</p><p>Further distinctions are too murky to really make, much less estimate.</p>
