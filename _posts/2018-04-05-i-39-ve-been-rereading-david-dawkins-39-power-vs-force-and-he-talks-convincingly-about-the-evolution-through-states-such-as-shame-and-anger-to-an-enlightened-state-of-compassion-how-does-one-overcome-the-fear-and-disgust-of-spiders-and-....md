<p>You might try keeping a pet rat. And perhaps a tarantula as well.</p><p>I don’t know if you were expecting a magic solution, but as someone with extensive experience with both David Hawkins and in magic, mundane solutions are better if you can find them.</p><p>That said, rats and spiders are disease carriers and should be eradicated from your home anyway if they’re living ‘wild’. Just don’t do it out of disgust and anger and you will be better off.</p>
