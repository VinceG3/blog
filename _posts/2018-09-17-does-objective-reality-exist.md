title: Does objective reality exist?

<p>In the sense of the world we normally deal with, reality exists in the mind.</p><p>Think about a chair. What makes that specific cluster of atoms a chair? Only your mind. The same is true of every single thing you actually deal with on a day to day basis. The only thing that makes the cluster of atoms that make up the thing you’re in right now your house is ideas in your mind. If there were no humans around to think the idea that “this is a house” then it ceases to be a house.</p><p>Systems of government, companies, laws are all held together by human minds. Your friendships would cease to be without your mind.</p><p>Without us, there would be nothing around to call it reality.</p><p>Objectivity exists, but only because it’s held in more than one mind. Put bullets through those minds, and the objectivity goes away along with the minds.</p>
