title: My friend who doesn&#39;t play computer games wants to get a Macbook Pro. Would it still be worth the money?

<p>I personally have stopped buying MacBooks because they’re insanely susceptible to liquid damage, and Apple has managed to hoodwink us all into thinking that’s normal. It’s not, Louis Rossmann has a video of him shooting a hose at a ThinkPad for like ten minutes before it even so much as hiccupped, it didn’t need repair and I think he’s still using it.</p><p>If you don’t mind buying a new machine every few years, after the warranty expires, because they always seem to fail right after the warranty expires, and the repair costs are carefully calibrated to push you into just buying a new one, buy a Mac. If the prospect of having a hardware failure that ruins the machine and Apple won’t repair even if you buy the AppleCare plan, buy a Mac.</p>
