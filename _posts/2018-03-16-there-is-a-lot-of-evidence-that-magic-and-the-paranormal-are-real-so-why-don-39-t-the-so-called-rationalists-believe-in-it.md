title: There is a lot of evidence that magic and the paranormal are real, so why don&#39;t the so-called rationalists believe in it?

<p>What's this evidence? I believe in magick, even if I don't practice it, and I can even accept the paranormal, but even I wouldn't try to pretend there's evidence for it.</p><p>It's just not how the spirit world works. Everybody gets to believe in what they want to believe. If you do magick and I don't want to believe in it, then I won't see or feel your magick, <b>even if it did what you wanted it to do</b>. That's how it works. No system of magick allows you to force somebody to believe in it. This completely precludes leaving evidence for scientists to pick up on.</p>
