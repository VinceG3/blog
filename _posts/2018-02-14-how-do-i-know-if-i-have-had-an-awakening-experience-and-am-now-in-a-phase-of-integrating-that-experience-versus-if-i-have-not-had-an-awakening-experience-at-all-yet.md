title: How do I know if I have had an awakening experience and am now in a phase of integrating that experience, versus if I have not had an awakening experience at all yet?

<p>You’re always integrating <i>something</i>. Whether that thing is spiritual awakening or not is really up to you. You can conjure up some previous life awakening and examine your life as an integration of that. The sky’s the limit.</p><p>Really though you should get used to thinking of your daily life as a spiritual experience. If you think about it, material existence is <b>weird</b>. You’ve spent far more time in this universe not existing in a material body as you ever will in one.</p>
