<p>Really, it’s not up to you. Altruism is an evolved component of the human brain. It controls to a large degree <i>the things you want</i>. What people call “moral fibre” is when people take this and go further with it, developing strong guidelines to their behavior and their actions.</p><p>Even if you don’t go that far, the part of your brain that governs setting up what you want is just not going to make you want to, say, cheat a little old granny. Even criminals have moral codes. This is because criminality has little to do with morals and more to do with self-interest. Self-interest overrides your morals, but only up to a degree.</p><p>But really there’s more to it than that. Even psychopaths can be moral. The reason why is that humans are a social species, working together is required for success. Morality is required for others to trust you. Even if you don’t want to actually be moral, you’re going to have to at least pretend to be if you want to get anything done.</p>
