title: &quot;Sell your soul to Satan.&quot; Why would Satan want someone&#39;s soul? What does he gain from it?

<p>Satan is the purveyor of evil, he tempts us into compromising morals for comfort. When you sell your soul to Satan, you trade eternity in Heaven for pleasure on Earth and damnation in Hell. The ‘selling’ implies a transaction, but Satan cares about each individual transaction about as much as the cable companies care about their customers. No, Satan is running a much bigger scam.</p><p>What does he get out of it? Well, more denizens of Hell of course! Hell is like a huge farm where there’s never enough people around to do all the work. If there ever was, the master of the farm would lead everyone out to a new field and say, “plow that, I expect 200 new bushels next harvest.”</p><p>Satan likes it when you boil in the lake of fire, it pleases him. That’s what he gets out of it. The angels sing in heaven to glorify God, you could have gone with them. Instead you get to scream in agony to glorify Satan.</p><p>Satan’s not a cultured kinda fella.</p>
