title: Would you rather be forced to marry someone who was an exact replica of you personality wise or your polar opposite?

<p>Exact replica. One of the things I’ve learned more and more as I date is that if you like yourself, you’ll only really fit with people like you. If you don’t like yourself, or rather, if you’re just kind of tired of yourself, you’ll look at people you perceive like you as boring. Being tired of myself is not my default state, it’s something I only do once in awhile. I’ll go find some different situation, and find another road back to self-enjoyment.</p><p>To have someone else in my life that’s a polar opposite of my personality would mean never really being able to relax. As a result I’ve been getting way clearer lately on who I want to date.</p>
