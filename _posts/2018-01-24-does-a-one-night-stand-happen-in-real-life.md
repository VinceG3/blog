<p>One night stands were my primary form of sexytime throughout my twenties. I had perhaps ten of them across ten years.</p><p>It sucked. Do not recommend. I never got to know any of them, and it was always in weird situations where there couldnâ€™t be any followup sexytime.</p><p>They sound totally awesome, but eventually you just want something regular with someone you know well.</p>
