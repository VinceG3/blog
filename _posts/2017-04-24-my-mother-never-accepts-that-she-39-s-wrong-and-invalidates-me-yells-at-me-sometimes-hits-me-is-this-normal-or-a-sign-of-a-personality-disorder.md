title: My mother never accepts that she&#39;s wrong and invalidates me, yells at me, sometimes hits me. Is this normal, or a sign of a personality disorder?

<p>Look at it this way. If it was a personality disorder, how would that change anything? Would you, every time she shuts you down, call her a narcissist or whatever? Would you try to heal her?</p>
