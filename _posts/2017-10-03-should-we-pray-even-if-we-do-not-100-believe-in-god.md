<p>Prayer is just meditation with belief. Many times my meditation sessions turned into spontaneous prayer sessions. I just felt it and decided to go with it.</p><p>Prayer feels wonderful. You’re surrendering your immediate mental state so that you can feel a greater connection with, well, something. You don’t have to have a particular deity in mind when you’re praying. But the particular mental state of prayer won’t happen unless you’re actually externalizing towards something.</p><p>It’s hard to miss once you’ve felt it.</p>
