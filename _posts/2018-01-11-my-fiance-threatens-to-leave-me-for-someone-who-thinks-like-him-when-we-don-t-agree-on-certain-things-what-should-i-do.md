<p>If it were me, I’d call her bluff. If she wasn’t bluffing, then your marriage was going to royally suck anyway. If she was, then she’s going to have to find a less manipulative way to gain agreement on the things that are important to her.</p><p>Best do this before the wedding. You don’t want to find out how serious she is about her relationship with you after you get married.</p>
