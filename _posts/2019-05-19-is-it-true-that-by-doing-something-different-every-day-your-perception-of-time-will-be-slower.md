title: Is it true that by doing something different every day, your perception of time will be slower?

<p>Yes, this will naturally slow time perception. But what really slows it down is concentration. When you attune your mind to discovering the finer gradations of things, particularly of things that are moving, your mind will speed up so it can keep up with the movement. It’s a great thing to practice and it’s how I hold my own in fighting games and ping pong with players with a lot more practice than me.</p><p>I very much recommend picking up a ‘twitchy’ type of video game and learning to concentrate on individual events in real time. The dopamine rush is intense.</p>
