title: It&#39;s a big, huge turn on for me, when negative gender roles get reversed, i.e. when a female abuses, stalks, harms a guy in all possible ways. Am I mad?

<p>I’ve read a lot of stories with those themes on Literotica. It’s an interesting fantasy, somewhat akin to non-consent / rape where the author has to be extremely careful in crafting the perfect situation for the reader to get off on it while avoiding any semblance of normality.</p><p>Eroticism is mental self-therapy. People with traumatic pasts will develop fetishes around “turning the tables.” But even in the absence of trauma people can develop weird little hang-ups, and erotic exploration can be a quite effective way out of some dark mental places.</p><p>So long as it doesn’t cross the line into actual cruelty, I’d give it the thumbs up in the same way I look at violent video games as a cathartic release rather than a dangerous addiction.</p>
