title: What does it mean to be conscious of your spiritual need?

<p>Spirit doesn’t have needs, we do. Our spirit is the part of us that is connected to God. We often say that God wants X or Y from us, but what that really means is that we need X or Y in order to better feel connected to God. God helps and supports us in our individual journeys and has no need to clone himself by making everyone like Him.</p><p>A better word for what you’re after is <i>yearning</i>. We yearn to be connected and engaged at all levels, particularly the spiritual. You can be more or less aware of that yearning, but it’s still there in virtually everybody, even atheists. They just don’t call the spiritual parts of themselves spiritual.</p>
