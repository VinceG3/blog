<p>How many times does He need to do this? He did this to Adam and Eve, to Noah, to Abraham, to all the Patriarchs, to David, then to Jesus. He directed the writing and ensured the transcription of an entire series of books to tell everyone. You can get one of these books literally anywhere. He’ll reveal His secrets to anyone who prays to Him, the living word still lives.</p><p>The problem is that people don’t listen. Not that He won’t tell them.</p>
