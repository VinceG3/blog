title: I still don’t know what an unguided meditation is. All I have been doing are the meditations that came with the course. I can’t find anything in Kabat-Zinn. Can you give an example of unguided meditation?

<p>The way i learned how to meditate, I had a teacher guide me through the meditations, in person, answer my questions, then I'd go home and do the <i>exact same meditations</i> without the "training wheels." Repetition is key. Think of it as brain training. You can't win a marathon without lots of running, right? You just do it over and over.</p><p>Eventually your mind will start coming up with it's own content.</p>
