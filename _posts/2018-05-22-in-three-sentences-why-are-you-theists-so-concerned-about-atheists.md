title: In three sentences, why are you theists so concerned about atheists?
date: 2018-05-22

<p>Why do you want only three sentences? Why bother asking questions if you don’t want to hear the full exposition of the answer? But whatever, I’ll play ball.</p><p>I concern myself with atheism because I find that their beliefs form a particularly nasty bit of ego, one I’m particularly familiar with because I have often shared it. But while I would never proselytize to someone unasked, answering Quora questions allows me to say the things I want to say to them anyway. I hope for my answers to reduce the nasty effects of that aforementioned ego on their thoughts and prejudices, even though I don’t hope to actually change their minds.</p><p>There’s your three sentences. Go in peace, friend.</p>
