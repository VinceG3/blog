<p>Respect and religion are two words that donâ€™t go together for most atheists. So while they <i>could,</i> most of them never <i>would</i>.</p><p>Even when I was an atheist, I like to think that I treated theists with as much respect as I could have mustered, you know, thinking I was superior to them and all.</p>
