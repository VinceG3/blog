<p>Wisdom is a very very old concept. The Bible dealt with it extensively. It tries to answer the question, “how does one best live?” It was necessarily interwoven with the local religion, since the local religion determined culture, tradition and values.</p><p>Every region generally evolved similar cultures and traditions that largely revolved around geography. The Greeks evolved a very different religion than the Egyptians did, and this can be pretty much entirely attributed to the difference in how they made their livings off the land.</p><p>Philosophy is what the Greeks invented. As maritime traders, they were exposed to many different types of religions and ways of thinking, and managed to build up enough of an aristocracy that they could afford to have a bunch of people sitting around not doing much. Among the many things they invented was philosophy, the so-called ‘love of wisdom’.</p><p>Ancient philosophy attempted to tease out transcendent principles among the many different kinds of religion created by the many different regions of the world.</p><p>One of these philosophical concepts was knowledge. The study of how we know what we know is today called epistemology. This Euler diagram represents the ancient description of knowledge:</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-942a99d48a8faabaca4d0229ec58e2e7.webp"><p><i>Source Wikipedia</i></p><p>Truth means something that holds true to the facts. Beliefs mean something that a person can think. Once you unite truth and beliefs, you still need a justification for why you should treat these things as <i>knowledge</i>.</p><p>This standard for knowledge held for two thousand years until 1963, when an American academic philosopher managed to challenge the Justified True Belief standard of knowledge, throwing the whole field into disarray.</p>
