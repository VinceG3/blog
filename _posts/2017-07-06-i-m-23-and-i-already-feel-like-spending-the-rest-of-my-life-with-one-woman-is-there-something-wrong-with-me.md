title: I’m 23 and I already feel like spending the rest of my life with one woman. Is there something wrong with me?

<p>You just might be my sister’s fiancee. If that’s indeed you, Josh, know that I love you and you are welcome into the family, but why couldn’t you just wait a reasonable amount of time before popping the question so that everyone else can believe you guys can stick it out for the long term? It would have made everything so much easier.</p><p>Since it’s very probably not, let me say that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with you. This sort of experience has been branded into our brains over millions of years and it’s how we managed to survive to make cars and iPhones. My only wish to you is to try to listen to the people around you and know that they’re probably not out to get you, they just want peace and harmony.</p><p>The things kids do when they’re in love, jeez.</p>
