title: What do you tell someone who is really depressed? They feel so much like crap, and anytime you talk to them about the Love of God, they cuss at you and God. What are the words that you can tell them?

<p>The best thing to do for someone like that is to just be there for them. They’re not going to be able to magically find God just because you think it would be great for them to. People have to be ready first, and you can’t know what’s really going on in their head.</p><p>Do you want to know what’s going on in their head? Maybe don’t try to put your words in their head, maybe let them put their words in your head.</p><p>Listen to them. When talking fails, listen. And when you start listening, don’t stop listening until they’re ready to stop. When do you start talking again? When they ask you to. What do you talk to them about? What they find important. Not what you find important.</p><p>That’s what “being there for someone” means. That they get to be important.</p>
