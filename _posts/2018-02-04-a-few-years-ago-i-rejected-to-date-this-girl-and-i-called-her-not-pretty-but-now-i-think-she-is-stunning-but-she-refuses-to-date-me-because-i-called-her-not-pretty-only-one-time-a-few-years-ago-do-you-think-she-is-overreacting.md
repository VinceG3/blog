title: A few years ago I rejected to date this girl and I called her not pretty, but now I think she is stunning but she refuses to date me because I called her not pretty only one time a few years ago. Do you think she is overreacting?

<p>Do I think she’s overreacting? No, I don’t. You can’t expect people to magically ascertain the state of mind you were in when you made a particular comment or answered a question. People can and should take whatever you said at 100% face value and not give you the benefit of the doubt that you’ve changed your mind <i>especially if you haven’t communicated to them that you were wrong</i>.</p>
