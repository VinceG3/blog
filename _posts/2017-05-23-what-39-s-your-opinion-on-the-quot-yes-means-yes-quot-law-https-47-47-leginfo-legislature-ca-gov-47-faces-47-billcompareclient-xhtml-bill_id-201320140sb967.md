<p>The most interesting aspect of the law I just read is that it doesn’t not actually change the definition of the crime of rape. What it does do is force universities to add language to their disciplinary policies and to implement outreach programs intended to educate students on the meaning of consent.</p><p>As written, I have no objections to the letter of the law. I would have more of an opinion if it actually tried to redefine rape or sexual assault to be more inclusive or to reduce the ability of campus administration to exercise judgment, and made every incident a matter for the police to sort out.</p><p>Most of this objection comes down to both my experience as being close to someone that has sex offender status as well as my understanding of the legal system and how it works. We absolutely do <b>not</b> need to be funneling kids through the sex offender ringer before we’ve adequately gotten a handle on sexual assault.</p><p>As written, this law is scary enough to get it through their thick skulls that assault is not okay, while not throwing away the future of every kid that makes a mistake.</p><p>We need to end rape culture on campus, this law is intended to be a scalpel and not a sledgehammer, and I applaud the government of the state of California for being able to see the difference.</p><p>People are wondering whether this law shifts the burden of proof or not. It does no such thing. It makes specific procedural directives for campus incidents. If the matter ends up going to trial, the evidence collected through following the directives will be entered into evidence at trial.</p><p>Rape will be the same, the burden of proof will be the same, rape trials will be the same. I think this part of society functions more or less adequately, so I am happy that ham-fisted legislators are not attempting to play judge here.</p>
