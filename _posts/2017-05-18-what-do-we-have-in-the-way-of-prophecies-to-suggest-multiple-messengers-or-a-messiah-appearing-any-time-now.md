title: What do we have in the way of prophecies to suggest multiple messengers or a messiah appearing any time now?

<p>A2A, Hell if I know. Prophecy doesn’t become prophecy until hundreds of years after it’s fulfilled. Before it’s fulfilled it’s just “rantings of someone who wants the world to be better / worse.”</p><p>Prophets are an interesting bunch. The act of prophecy has to be distinguished from ‘mere’ soothsaying, augury, or divination. Prophets have to be adjudicated for the ones more interested in worldly ambition than in simply conveying God’s will. So a would-be prophet has to toe a fine line.</p><p>Prophecies suggesting messengers seems a bit weird. Isn’t a prophecy a message? Are we having a pre-meeting meeting so we can pre-plan the plan? Prophesizing a messiah at least makes sense.</p>
