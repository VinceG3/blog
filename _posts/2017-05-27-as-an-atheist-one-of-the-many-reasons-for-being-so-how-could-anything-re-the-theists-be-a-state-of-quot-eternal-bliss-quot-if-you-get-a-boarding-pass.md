title: As an atheist, (one of the many reasons for being so), how could anything (re the theists) be a state of &quot;eternal bliss&quot; if you get a boarding pass?

<p>Bliss is not joy. Joy taxes your emotional center, flooding your mind and grabbing your attention. Bliss is different.</p><p>Bliss is waking up in the morning in a house you own, a bed youâ€™ve woken up in for the last 20 years, that you built with your soon-to-be husband soon after you moved in together. Bliss is then moving into the kitchen and smelling the coffee your beloved made and poured you a cup of when he sensed you were up and about.</p><p>Bliss is then sharing breakfast with him while planning out your day. Bliss is handling deviations from your plans with grace and foresight. Bliss is going to church and participating in a ritual that has been done continuously for thousands of years.</p><p>Eternal bliss is the realization that all of the Christians that have done the hard work of building these traditions, rituals, and cultures all went to the same place after they died and are continuing the good work of studying, glorifying, and worshipping the source of everything in the world.</p>
