<p>I don’t think it’s too bad. You want to work on simplifying, use fewer concepts and relate them to each other so it doesn’t sound like you’re just tossing shit against the wall and seeing what sticks, which is what the other guy is accusing you of.</p><p>For example, the mention of the <i>corpus callosum</i> is, in my opinion, unnecessary, but if you want to make it more of a driver, put it first and relate the rest of the philosophy to it.</p><p>There’s a logic and a rhythm to this sort of dialectic. You have to strike a fine balance between too much explanation, and not enough. So you need to keep working on it.</p><p>This effort is ultimately why we have religion. It’s much easier to come up with something coherent and compelling when you have thousands of poets working on it. Spirituality is going it alone, you’re just not going to be able to get everything perfectly right. Ignore the haters and keep blazing your own truth.</p>
