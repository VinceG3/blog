title: Why none of Osho&#39;s disciples are enlightened?

<p>Osho was unique even among enlightened sages. Very few of them have a talent for self promotion or the capability to stand in the media’s eye for long. So as a result you might look at the fact that none of his disciples carried on his legacy in exactly the way he did as proof that he wasn’t enlightened or that he wasn’t able to teach.</p><p>Nothing is further from the truth. He created scores of enlightened students that approach spirituality in the same way he was when he was younger, irreverent yet still respectful, humorous and graceful.</p><p>But there could only ever be one Osho. No need for anyone else to become him.</p>
