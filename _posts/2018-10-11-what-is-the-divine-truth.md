<p>Think about truth. What is it? Think about all meaning as fitting in a fabric, a map if you will. Don’t think too hard about it, it’ll hurt your brain to think about what the dirt actually consists of. But truth, truth is a straight line over that map. Because the terrain is full of obstacles, you can’t just walk in straight lines most of the time. Any direction you walk in, if you walk a straight line, you’re walking true. A blade is true when it doesn’t warp or have any kinks or bends.</p><p>Humans are limited by the obstacles. It can take us our entire lives to find truth, a direction we can start walking in, and keep walking in for the rest of our lives.</p><p>Divine truth is when God sweeps aside the obstacles and shows us the way.</p>
