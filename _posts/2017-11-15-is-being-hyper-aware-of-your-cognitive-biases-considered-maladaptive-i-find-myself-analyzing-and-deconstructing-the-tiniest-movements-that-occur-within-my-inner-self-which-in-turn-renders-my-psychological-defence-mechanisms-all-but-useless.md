title: Is being hyper-aware of your cognitive biases considered maladaptive? I find myself analyzing and deconstructing the tiniest movements that occur within my inner self, which in turn renders my psychological defence mechanisms all but useless.

<p>Anything done deeply enough will morph into a spiritual path. You struggle to get started, finally find traction, then you hit a tipping point where it becomes real, then you fall deep into the abyss, and slowly crawl your way out of it. You appear to be at the “finding traction” point in the path. Keep at it, you’ll soon discover amazing truths about yourself and others. Don’t worry about the abyss, it doesn’t do much if your path isn’t a mystical one.</p>
