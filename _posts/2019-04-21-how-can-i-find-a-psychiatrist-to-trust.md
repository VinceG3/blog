title: How can I find a psychiatrist to trust?

<p>The way I have always found professionals to trust with my money and well-being, has always been to ask friends and family. Whether it's an auto mechanic or a funeral director or an interior decorator, I'm going to find someone I trust to recommend someone that <i>they</i> trust, then let the professional know who sent them, so they know it's not just a matter of money here, reputations are at stake.</p><p>With a psychiatrist, I think it's important to have a "primary mental health care" psychologist to have a talk therapy relationship with. I do not think drugs by themselves can work very well without a talk therapy context to place them in.</p><p>To find my talk therapy psychologist, I asked a friend who was a psychologist for a reference. Then when it came time to explore psychiatric options, I asked my psychologist for a reference.</p>
