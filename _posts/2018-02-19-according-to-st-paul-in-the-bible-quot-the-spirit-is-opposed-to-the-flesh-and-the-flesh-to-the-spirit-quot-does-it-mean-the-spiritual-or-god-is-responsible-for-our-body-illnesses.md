title: According to St Paul in the Bible, &quot;the spirit is opposed to the flesh, and the flesh to the spirit,&quot; does it mean the spiritual (or God) is responsible for our body illnesses?

<p>God made this world, for us to live in. It’s filled with all kinds of fun distractions from that fact. When we are in need, in trouble, when the world of the flesh fails to sustain us, we turn to God, and when God helps us, we tend to forget God.</p><p>So there’s this constant push-pull dynamic between us and the world of flesh and the world of God. You might feel guilty turning away from or even forgetting about God after He has helped you, but that’s really just part of His plan. Only a few people can ever devote their whole lives to contemplating Him.</p><p>Once you achieve success in your Earthly life, that provides another opportunity to turn to God. This is a good time to set routines and little rituals, like actually going to church every Sunday. God can enrich even the most successful person’s life, but that person has to want it.</p>
