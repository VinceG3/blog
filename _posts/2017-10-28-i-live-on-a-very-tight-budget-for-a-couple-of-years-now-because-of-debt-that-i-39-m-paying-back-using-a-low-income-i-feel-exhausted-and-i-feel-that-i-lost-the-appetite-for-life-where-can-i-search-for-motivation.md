title: I live on a very tight budget for a couple of years now because of debt that I&#39;m paying back using a low income. I feel exhausted and I feel that I lost the appetite for life. Where can I search for motivation?

<p>You should not have to motivate yourself to enjoy your lifestyle. The enjoyment should come automatically.</p><p>When I was in my early twenties I very often had very little disposable income. Regardless, I found stuff to do. I’d pick up books from the local library, take walks, do crafty things to improve my quality of life. For example, one winter I noticed that running my heater was really expensive. So I mostly left it off and built a little “cave” out of $10 worth of PVC pipe and blankets. Inside was my computer and a space heater. I lived there all winter and played lots of games and talked with all kinds of people online.</p><p>If you’re more extraverted you should go talk to the neighbors more. Human connection makes anything bearable.</p><p>Now I have lots of money but I still make sure my lifestyle doesn’t outpace my earnings. Just don’t attach your happiness to money and it’s not hard.</p>
