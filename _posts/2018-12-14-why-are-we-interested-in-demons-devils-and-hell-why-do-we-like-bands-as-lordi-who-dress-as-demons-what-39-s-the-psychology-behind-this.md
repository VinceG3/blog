title: Why are we interested in demons, devils, and hell? Why do we like bands as Lordi (who dress as demons)? What&#39;s the psychology behind this?

<p>These things fascinate us because there’s always an aspect of human nature that wants to walk on the wild side, taking what we want just because we want it and kicking contemplation of the consequences down the road until they actually manifest.</p><p>The thematics of hell, the look of demons and devils and the whole setting, varies all over the world. The personalities of hellish denizens also vary. Some culture’s demons might be portrayed as angry all the time, another’s might like sterner, even-headed devils that, rather than violently punish, instead lead people astray, tricking them into compromising their morals, and smiling with vicious satisfaction as the choices they made lead them to ruin by their own hand.</p><p>The common thread running through all of this is very simple, selfishness. We know we cannot be selfish, so we live vicariously through people that do, and then validate our choice to remain altruistic by enjoying their punishment at the hands of hellish agents.</p>
