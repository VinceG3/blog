<p>Iâ€™m not at all sure that deep feelings ever really goes away. It might get hidden under a pile of crap but it's always there, ever-present. Whether it actually presents at the moment as sexual attraction or not might wax and wane, but the feelings will still be there and sexual attraction can be rekindled.</p><p>The trick is to get the other person to see you in a new light. Show a different part of your personality to him, give him something he hasn't seen from you yet.</p><p>We're attracted to the new and shiny, the old and dull just won't motivate. So make yourself new and shiny.</p>
