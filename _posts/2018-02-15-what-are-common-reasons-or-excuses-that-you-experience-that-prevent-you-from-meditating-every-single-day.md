<p>I've been trying to meditate more. Sometimes when I go to bed, I wake up around 4–5 am, this is the best time I've found for meditating. If I don't happen to wake up early like that, I don't bother trying. I used to, but the sessions I attempt outside of the ritual and routine I’ve created and set aside for myself late at night just never have the same potency.</p><p>I take daily walks, these sometimes morph into spiritual meditation. I don’t try to coerce any particular session, walking or late-night, into a form. If I’m not feeling trance work, I won’t do trance work.</p><p>I’ve been moving through an arc recently that I’ve termed “retrograde.” Basically instead of moving deeper with every session, I’ve been moving “shallower.” The idea is to pay very close attention to the little steps that lead into the really heavy trance states, so that I can make them easier to traverse.</p><p>Trance work has me progressively shift away from my body and into a formless realm. My technique for accomplishing this has been refined over many years, but I’d never really cared to ‘perfect’ it. It’s my goal over the next year or so to finally get there.</p><p>But it moves at it’s own pace. Meditation can’t be forced.</p>
