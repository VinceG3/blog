title: Would you shop in a store that has a &quot;no gays&quot; sign in the window? A hardware store has put up such a sign after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

<p>I passed up a gas station that had a massive Confederate “battle” flag flying in a position that made it look like theirs. No way would I ever step foot into a place of business that felt the need to make such a statement. As I was passing it up, I realized that the flag wasn’t actually on the gas station’s property. I bet the owners of the gas station just <b>love</b> their neighbors.</p>
