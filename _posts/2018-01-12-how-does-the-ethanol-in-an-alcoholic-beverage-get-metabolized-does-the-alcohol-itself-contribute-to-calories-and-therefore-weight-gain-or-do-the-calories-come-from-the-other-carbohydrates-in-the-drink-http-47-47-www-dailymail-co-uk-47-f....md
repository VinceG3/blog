title: How does the ethanol in an alcoholic beverage get metabolized? Does the alcohol itself contribute to calories, and therefore weight gain, or do the calories come from the other carbohydrates in the drink?

<p>The Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_metabolism" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Ethanol metabolism</a> is instructive. The other two answers are directly at odds with this information.</p><p>Ethanol is highly bioavailable and most of it gets absorbed into the bloodstream by your stomach and small intestine. It works its way around the body and eventually lands in the liver.</p><p>The liver turns the ethanol into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is both toxic and carcinogenic, so the body can’t leave it sitting around for long. The reason it’s toxic is because it is unstable and breaks down into free radicals unless it is quickly quenched by anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C.</p><p>What usually happens next is the acetaldehyde is converted in the liver to acetic acid, a much more benign compound. If it isn’t, then it’ll make it to the bloodstream. If you’ve ever heard of “Asian glow”, it’s caused by a genetic incapability of metabolizing acetaldehyde. It builds up in the bloodstream and causes all kinds of problems.</p><p>Finally the acetic acid gets distributed throughout the body and is used as an energy source by mitochondria and also is broken down by enzyme to acetyl-CoA.</p><p>Acetyl-CoA is used directly by the body as an energy source through the <i>citric acid cycle</i>. Excess acetyl-CoA is converted into fatty acids by the liver and the fatty acids are taken up by adipose tissue and turned into fat.</p><p>So yes, alcohol is an energy source and it will contribute to weight gain. It’s not metabolized in precisely the same way and does have a drug-like effect on the mind, so people often mistake ethanol for not being a significant macronutrient. But it is indeed treated like one by the body.</p>
