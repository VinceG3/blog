<p>In the past I would have told you no, you’re just hurting yourself.</p><p>These days the demand is so high that you’d really have to shoot yourself in the foot to stay unemployed for long if you have any kind of skills or even just the ability to lie about your skills.</p><p>So go ahead, quit your job. Another sucker will just line up to throw cash at you to hate their job.</p>
