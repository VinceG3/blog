<p>They’ve all been chased away by atheist trolls.</p><p>I’ve seen this happen many times on Internet forums. A smart, self-aware theist joins a forum looking for quality engagement. Instead the hordes of atheists all collectively throw their shit at him like so many monkeys. I try to protect them, but eventually they all leave the community, citing the same thing.</p><p>They could fight one atheist, even a small group of them.</p><p>But atheists have taken over the Internet and made every non-religiously-focused community an extremely hostile place for belief. And worse, <b>nobody calls them out on it</b>. They see it as their right to be absolute asses to people who don’t think the way they do.</p><p>So yeah. These rare birds have all flown south for the winter. And that winter is never going to end.</p>
