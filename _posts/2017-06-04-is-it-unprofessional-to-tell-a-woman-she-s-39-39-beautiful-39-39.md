<p>If you are in a professional context, than it is. Are you dropping beauty into a context where it doesn’t belong? If you’re turning a woman you should be dealing with professionally into a sex object, then that’s unprofessional, probably even inappropriate.</p><p>Wait until you’re not in a professional context to start flirting with her. You can ask her to lunch, then at the end of it, say you really enjoyed her company and would like to take her on a dinner date. Work lunches are friendly, but still professional. You can ask someone out in a friendly context. Dinner dates where it’s just the two of you are solidly personal. This is when you can flirt and be yourself.</p>
