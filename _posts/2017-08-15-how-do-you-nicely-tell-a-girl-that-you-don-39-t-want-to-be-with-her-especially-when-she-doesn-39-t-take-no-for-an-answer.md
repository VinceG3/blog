title: How do you nicely tell a girl that you don&#39;t want to be with her, especially when she doesn&#39;t take no for an answer?

<p>Courtesy is wasted on someone who doesn’t listen to anything you say. You tried being nice. Being nice didn’t work. It’s time to be mean. If being mean <i>still</i> doesn’t do the trick, then you need to pull out all the stops and stop being <b>courteous.</b> You can still be courteous and mean. But the message is impossible to miss if you’re not even giving her basic common courtesy while you’re telling her to fuck off.</p><p>If she doesn’t respect your wishes even when you’re being a total asshole, then it’s time to ruthlessly cut her out of your life. Block her number, turn the other way when you see her. If she still manages to find you even then, then you’re dealing with a stalker and you need to decide if and when it’s time to get the police involved. Other avenues like getting her parents / family involved become appropriate at this stage too. She might not listen to you, but she’ll usually listen to her brother / sister.</p>
