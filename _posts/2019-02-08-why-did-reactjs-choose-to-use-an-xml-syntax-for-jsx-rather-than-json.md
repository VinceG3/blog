title: Why did ReactJS choose to use an XML syntax for JSX rather than JSON?

<p>You can just use React.createElement and pass in Javascript objects to make a component if you want to do it that way.</p><p>But no one <b>likes</b> hand-editing JSON. XML is no picnic either, but markup is how developers have gotten used to specifying the structure over the last 30 years.</p>
