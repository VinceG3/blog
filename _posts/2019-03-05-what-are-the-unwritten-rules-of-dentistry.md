title: What are the unwritten rules of dentistry?

<p>I’m going to give an outsider’s perspective of how I perceive the dental field working. Maybe a real dentist can come in and give clarity to my observations.</p><ol><li>Never directly disparage another dentist’s work, even when it’s warranted. In order to get an honest opinion from a dentist, you must first get them roaring drunk.</li><li>Where you’re at on the totem pole of dentistry is determined not by how many clients you make happy, or whether you can make porcelain crowns onsite, but by how young and cute your hygienists are. God forbid you have even a single male hygienist.</li><li>You must ask for nitrous, they will never offer it to you. Never make the customer feel like a junkie, they’ll do that all on their own.</li><li>Never offer a cheaper service if a more expensive service could even barely, remotely fit the patient’s needs a smidge better. <b>Do</b> make the customer feel like a cheapskate and not invested in their own health for asking.</li><li>The field doesn’t really have any ethical standards. As a result, practices live and die by their Yelp ratings.</li></ol>
