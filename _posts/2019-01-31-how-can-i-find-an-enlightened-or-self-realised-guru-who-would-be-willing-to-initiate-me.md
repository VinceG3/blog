<p>What exactly about the act of initiation is supposed to get you anywhere close to enlightenment or self-realizing? It’s called “self-realization” for a reason, nobody else can do it for you.</p><p>I have been initiated, into a Wiccan coven, some 15 or so years ago. Initiation bound me to a group, created a sense of loyalty. I did rituals with these people, broke bread with them, even lived with one of my coven sisters for a short time.</p><p>You initiate into mystery religions, especially the ones that borrow from gnosticism, because there’s ‘secret knowledge’ that’s intended to be conveyed. You don’t share secret knowledge with the uninitiated, Jesus called it “casting your pearls before swine.”</p><p>But Buddhism is not secret knowledge. It’s not something that can be easily transmitted from someone who is enlightened to someone who isn’t. An enlightened person can act as an example, they can answer questions, but an initiation ceremony isn’t going to do anything. All the knowledge is public in readily-available books.</p>
