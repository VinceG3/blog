<p>Ah the old, “may God strike me down.” It didn’t convince believers then and it won’t today.</p><p>God chooses not to make himself known to any but avid believers. And when he does, he always chooses ways to do that that can be doubted.</p><p>If believing in God before getting the proof bothers you, then don’t bother. Atheism is hip today, just go do that.</p>
