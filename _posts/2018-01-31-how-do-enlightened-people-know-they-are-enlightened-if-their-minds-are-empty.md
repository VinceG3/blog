<p>The enlightened mind is not empty. Its normal state is sublime contemplation of the divine. The enlightened person can clear this contemplation away and concentrate if they wish. Then the mind is empty.</p><p>But the emptiness of mind is not like the emptiness of a pot that used to be filled with water. Itâ€™s more like the emptiness of a well. With the next rain comes more water. And you can make it rain whenever you want.</p>
