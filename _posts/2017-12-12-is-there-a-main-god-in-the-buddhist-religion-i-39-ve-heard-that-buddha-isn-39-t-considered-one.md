<p>There is no main god in Buddhism. Instead there are many many lesser divine beings. Note that divinity is hard to reason around and on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_deities" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Buddhist deities</a>, I found that I easily match the description of a deva.</p>
