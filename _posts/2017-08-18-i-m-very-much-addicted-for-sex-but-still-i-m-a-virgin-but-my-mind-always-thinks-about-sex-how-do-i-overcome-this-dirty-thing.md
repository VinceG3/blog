<p>Find someone to have it with. If you can’t, just masturbate. If masturbating once doesn’t help, what I’ve done in the past is block off entire days to just exploring sexuality. I’ll browse porn sites and especially Literotica. Then there’s toys. Of the things I’ve tried, the ones that have had the most impact were edging and using a hair tie to restrict blood flow to my testicles.</p><p>Eventually you’ll ‘get it out of your system’ for awhile. Edging is a whole lot of fun, but it takes a <i>long freaking time</i> to get to the point where it’s super intense. If I really had as much pent up demand as you seem to, that’s what I’d be doing. Basically you masturbate right until you’re about to have an orgasm, then stop. Then start again and stop before you climax. Keep doing it without cumming for as long as you can. It’s the most intense sexual experience I’ve ever had.</p><p>Honestly I’d do it more but I just don’t have that kind of driving libido these days. I get bored and want to go do something else.</p>
