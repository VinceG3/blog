title: If only very few attain enlightenment why millions keep trying, same hope as winning lottery?

<p>I don’t think millions are actually trying to acheive enlightenment. Millions certainly dabble, but very few of them ever rise to the level of serious seeker.</p><p>Of the ones that get serious about it, perhaps one in a hundred actually reach it. I don’t think it’s pure dumb luck, how you approach your search is very important. Trying to do it all by yourself makes you completely reliant on your own level of consciousness. Asking others for help allows you to access resources you never would have had access to otherwise.</p><p>If you went to the East and took a hard look at the spiritual environment there, you wouldn’t come to the same conclusion of enlightenment as basically rockstardom. It looks a lot more like yoga or whatever, with teachers everywhere. It’s not half as mysterious.</p>
