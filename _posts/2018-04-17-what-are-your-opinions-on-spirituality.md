title: What are your opinions on spirituality?

<p>Every concept needs to be positioned against other concepts so that people can understand what you’re trying to say. Most Westerners position spirituality on a continuum between ‘religious’ and ‘atheism’. I consider this toxic and I try not to do it.</p><p>For me, spirituality is simply a mode of thought. Anybody can think spiritually, no matter your creed. When you’re struck by the transcendent beauty of something, be it God or math or even a piece of music, you’re in a spiritual frame of mind. When you start applying lessons you learned in one arena to something utterly completely differently, you’re thinking spiritually.</p><p>So for me, spirituality is much better positioned against the frame of thinking <i>mundanely</i>. Framed this way, spirituality is always more fun. You always want to come across fascinating little connections between seemingly unrelated things. You always want more interconnection between whatever you’re doing now and that awesome thing you were doing yesterday late at night when you couldn’t sleep.</p><p>Spirituality is best defined as that which you can’t stop yourself from wanting to chase, learn about, and embody. Regardless of whatever your position on metaphysical mental constructs are.</p>
