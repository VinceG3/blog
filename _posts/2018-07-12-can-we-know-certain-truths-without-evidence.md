title: Can we know certain truths without evidence?

<p>The standard for epistemological knowledge since ancient Greece is that there are things that are true, things that can be believed, knowledge is the union of those two things combined with a justification.</p><p>Evidence is justification. We can know truths without justification, but those truths aren’t <i>knowledge</i> until they’re justified.</p><p>Science is a <i>kind</i> of knowledge. It concerns the effort to understand the world through empirical study. Science requires a particular approach called the scientific method.</p><p>Other kinds of knowledge use different kinds of justification. The field literally defines the justification. The process of law, cases, appeals, arguments, and so forth, is itself the justification process for legal knowledge. It makes sense for evidence to be a factor in a particular legal <i>case</i>, but not when it comes to overturning laws on the grounds of constitutionality. Judges have to sit around and argue over what would be best. The ‘evidence’, really justification, is that argument.</p><p>Plenty of things are scientific, but many many many things aren’t. These fields have to define their own process for justification.</p>
