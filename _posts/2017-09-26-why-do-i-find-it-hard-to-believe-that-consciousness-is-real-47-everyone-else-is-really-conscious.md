<p>You’re probably fairly young and your theory of mind hasn’t fully matured yet. Theory of mind is a term given to a specific part of the brain that is used to model how other people think. It’s used for pretty much anything social you need to do, for instance, trying to come up with an appropriate birthday gift for your mother. You need to model her mind in your mind so you can try to come up with something she’ll like.</p><p>Once this part of your brain matures, then you’ll start to realize that your thoughts are the same as other people’s thoughts and the question of whether other people are conscious or not will just fade from your life.</p>
