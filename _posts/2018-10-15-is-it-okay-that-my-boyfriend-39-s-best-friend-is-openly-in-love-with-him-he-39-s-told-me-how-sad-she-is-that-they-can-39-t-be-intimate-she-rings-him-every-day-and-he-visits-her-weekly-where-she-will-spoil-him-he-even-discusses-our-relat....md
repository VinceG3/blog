title: Is it okay that my boyfriend&#39;s best friend is openly in love with him? He&#39;s told me how sad she is that they can&#39;t be intimate. She rings him every day and he visits her weekly where she will spoil him. He even discusses our relationship with her.

<p>If you want a lovable guy, then you need to realize that women are going to fall in love with him. It’s the same the other way around. Guys want a hottie then get all jealous when other guys get hot and bothered around her.</p><p>You can’t ask your partner to refuse to have contact with them. That’s tantamount to dictating who they can spend time with and be friends with.</p><p>The best you can do is to get close to it. Make it fun so he doesn’t feel like he has to be guarded around the issue. He’ll tell you all the weird little silly things she’s trying to do to get him to leave you for her. They’ll sound stupid and desperate because they are.</p><p>Before long she’ll stop looking like a horrid temptress and instead start looking like a sad puppy whose fallen desperately in love with a proud wolf. You’ll want to help her find love and happiness of her own. Or you’ll just enjoy the feeling of being superior over her.</p><p>Either way, you shouldn’t begrudge a woman for liking the same things you like. You two are not all that different. You just managed to get there first and stronger.</p>
