<p>A2A, interesting question to ask a white guy. One of the privileges I enjoy as a white guy is the ability to walk away from it all. If someone tells me I’m X because of my skin color, I can simply raise an eyebrow, come up with a good, or not so good response, then leave the situation. After five minutes I’ve forgotten about it. It’s an aberration, a momentarily-annoying bump in the road. I can just shrug it off. I’m lucky. Most people can’t.</p>
