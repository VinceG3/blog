<p>Me, I’d probably say something like, “Well, duh, why do you think I’m dating you?” Then if she’s in range I’d smack her butt.</p><p>Really this depends on the girl. If she’s actually insecure about her looks I’d be more reassuring, less playful. If she’s super-secure, then I might just deadpan a “yep,” and then immediately start ignoring her. That’s usually good for a pinch or smack.</p><p>Whatever I do, I certainly wouldn’t be worried or anything over my response.</p>
