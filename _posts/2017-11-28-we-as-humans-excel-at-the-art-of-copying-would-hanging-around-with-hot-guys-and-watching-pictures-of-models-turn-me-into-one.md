title: We, as humans, excel at the art of copying. Would hanging around with hot guys and watching pictures of models turn me into one?

<p>No.</p><p>Modeling is a specific job. With a specific industry and cultures and ideas and expectations and all of that. If you hung around a bunch of lawyers all day, would that make you a lawyer?</p><p>Picking up the mannerisms and the elan of a model doesn’t make you one. You need to actually get a modeling job and belong to a modeling agency and all of that. That’s what makes you a model. Not any amount of copying.</p>
