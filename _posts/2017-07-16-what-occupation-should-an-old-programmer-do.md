title: What occupation should an old programmer do?

<p>Project managers who can code are very valuable. In fact, I predict project management demand will grow much much faster than programming demand, simply because it’s almost as hard to find good management as it is to find good engineering talent.</p><p>I do not recommend getting out of software anytime soon. Your skills atrophy quickly and while you might get some short-term satisfaction out of a career change, you’re ultimately shooting yourself in the foot.</p><p>Pretty much everyone I know that makes decent money is in software. Even hardware engineering is looking more and more like software development these days. Even my own step-dad, who was in the Marine Corps for <b>30 years</b>, now works in software, albeit for a government contractor.</p><p>Software jobs are the new factory jobs. A real game-changer for everyone who listens to their siren call.</p>
