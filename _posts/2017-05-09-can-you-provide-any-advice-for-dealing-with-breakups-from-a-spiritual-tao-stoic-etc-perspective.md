title: Can you provide any advice for dealing with breakups from a spiritual, tao, stoic, etc. perspective?

<p>I’ve had lots of heartbreak in my life. I dealt with it the same way I deal with any negative emotion, by meditating on it.</p><p>What I found out when I did my meditation was that relationships are basically like integrating your brain with another person. So when you break up then it’s like a part of you dies.</p><p>I also found out just how much of a role miscommunication plays in relationships and attraction. We build up these big pictures in our minds of who other people are and what role they play in our lives. A lot of that is ignorance and misunderstanding.</p><p>I also re-verified the need for reflection and analysis. If you don’t learn from a failed relationship then why did you have it in the first place?</p>
