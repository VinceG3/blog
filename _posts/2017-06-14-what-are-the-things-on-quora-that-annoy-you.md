<p>The most annoying part of Quora is easily the performance problems, which are the worst out of every social media platform I’ve ever used. Requests can regularly take 10 seconds to complete.</p><p>I’m not really in the market for a job right now, but if Quora wanted to hire me or the consulting company I work for to make their site more responsive I’d jump all over the opportunity.</p>
