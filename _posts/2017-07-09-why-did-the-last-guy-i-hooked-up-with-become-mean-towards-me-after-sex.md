title: Why did the last guy I hooked up with become mean towards me after sex?

<p>There’s this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-coital_tristesse" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">post-coital dysphoria</a>. It tripped me up the very first time I experienced it. You just shared a wonderful experience with someone, why do I have all these negative feelings?</p><p>My suggestion is to deal with it with humor and patience. I wouldn’t be surprised if mammals evolved it to encourage promiscuous mating behavior, thus ensuring more babies. Evil evolution!</p>
