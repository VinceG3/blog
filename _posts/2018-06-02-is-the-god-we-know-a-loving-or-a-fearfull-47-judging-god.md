<p>He’s whatever you need him to be.</p><p>Ancient Judea was a horrid place. Wars got started for no real reason. Rape was commonplace. You could get sold into slavery by your parents and there was nothing you could do about it.</p><p>What kind of beliefs do you think these people in that situation would have about God? Well, you don’t have to wonder, you can read the Bible, a collection of stories that the Judean people wrote about their lives and their beliefs and the ideas and myths they used to make sense of it all.</p><p>But God doesn’t have to be that way all the time. Those same people, a thousand years later, came up with the idea of God becoming a man and walking among us, teaching and doing good deeds.</p><p>Which is the real God? They all are. God is <b>whatever you need Him to be</b>.</p>
