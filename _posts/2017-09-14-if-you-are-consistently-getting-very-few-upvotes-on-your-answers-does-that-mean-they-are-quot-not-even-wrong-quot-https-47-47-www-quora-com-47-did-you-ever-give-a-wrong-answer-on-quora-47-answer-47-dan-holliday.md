<p>I get very few upvotes on my answers. (Shoutout to <a href="/profile/Jane-Botten">Jane Botten</a> for so often being the only one to upvote my best answers) I do not look at it as a function of the quality of my writing or the validity of my viewpoints, but simply as part and parcel of how Quora works and just that most people on social media simply aren’t interested in the real meat of what I have to say.</p><p>I’m used to it. Quora is just one in a very long line of social media apps I’ve written for over the last 15 or so years. My topics were just as niche then as they are now. No amount of attention or lack thereof will get me to stop thinking about the things I think about and writing about it is just part of thinking about it. If I want tons of attention I can just hang on the coattails of <a href="/profile/Franklin-Veaux">Franklin Veaux</a> or <a href="/profile/Gordon-Miller-21">Gordon Miller</a>. I don’t because it’s just not my bag.</p><p>I never bother to cultivate an audience or a brand because that would just take time away from the thinking. Money and fame only mildly interest me. I want to dig into the junction between the rational and the irrational. I’ve long since accepted the fact that my writings will only truly interest maybe 3 or 4 people tops on any given platform.</p>
