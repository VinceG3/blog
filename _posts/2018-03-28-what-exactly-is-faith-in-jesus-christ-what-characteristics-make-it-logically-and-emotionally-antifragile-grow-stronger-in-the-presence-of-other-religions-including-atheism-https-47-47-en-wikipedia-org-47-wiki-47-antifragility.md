<p>Mysticism is the process of cultivating belief. It requires three basic things. First, the willingness to suspend disbelief. If you're materialistically minded, then you'll find this difficult but not impossible. I was able to get over it using a teacher.</p><p>Second you need a path to follow. You can find these pretty much anywhere. Books are a great resource. Basically, a path is a prescribed set of actions to do in meditation or prayer, and a description of what you're supposed to be feeling.</p><p>Finally, you need to stick with it. Do the exercises regularly, and note your progress. If you don't like the path, find a new one to follow. But give it an honest shot first.</p><p>Belief doesn't just magically come from nowhere, outs built. You have to do the building. I can say from experience that it's worth doing even if the belief winds up being wrong in the end.</p><p>Anti-fragility is arrived at eventually. You can't rush it. But one day you'll realize that something's clicked, that you can no longer go back to your old way of life. Unless you're in a cult, this lasts the rest of your life.</p>
