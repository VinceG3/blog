title: What do you call a worldview that says that there are objective truths, accessible using human reason, that exist whether we have uncovered them yet or not, but doesn&#39;t deny a transcendent moral reality, a relatively fixed human nature, or free will?

<p>Call it whatever the heck you want. If your name is John Souter, call it Souterism. It’s what everyone else will do anyway if they care enough about your position to talk about it with others.</p><p>There are <i>way way way</i> too many positions on the philosophical / religious spectrum to give them all names. Names denote relevance, they mean someone’s talking about a concept often enough that they need a convenient handle to refer to it by.</p><p>Guess what the position that Jesus was not, in fact, the Son of God and was just an ordinary person was called? Arianism, after it’s most notable proponent, Arius.</p><p>Concepts only earn ‘real’ names when they become mainstream. If Arianism had won over trinitarianism, then the trinitarian position would have been left with a personal name just like Arianism was. Christianity itself is an example of this, it was called the ‘cult of Jesus’ by the Romans until it got big enough to earn a big-boy name. If it didn’t win, we’d just call it “Jesusism” or something similar.</p>
