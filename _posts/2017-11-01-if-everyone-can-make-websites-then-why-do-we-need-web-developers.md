title: If everyone can make websites, then why do we need web developers?

<p>Everyone <b>can’t</b> make websites. Very few people are actually any good at it. The people that are decent at using other people’s frameworks aren’t any good at coming up with those frameworks themselves.</p><p>There are many, many, many web frameworks in the world. But the vast majority of them are made by software engineers and are tuned to very specific needs. And even the general purpose ones really suck when taken too far outside their domain.</p><p>Web developers are needed because normal people can’t make sense of the interfaces between systems, or how to extend and grow them. I wish it were easier to divide up the work between people who aren’t skilled web devs and people who are. It would take a whole lot of drudgery out of my job.</p>
