<p>God is <i>omnipotent</i>, meaning he can do anything he wants. If you perceive that you had a choice to accept God’s help or not, then God wanted to you feel like you had a choice. He didn’t have to do that. He could have just gotten you out of the situation you needed help with point blank, no input from you needed.</p><p>It goes deeper than that. God is <i>omniscient</i>. Meaning, when God offers you a choice, he knew before he even gave it to you whether you were going to take it or not. In fact, he set up the entire situation so that you would choose the way that you did. He set it up so that you could reflect on it and understand yourself and gain insight.</p>
