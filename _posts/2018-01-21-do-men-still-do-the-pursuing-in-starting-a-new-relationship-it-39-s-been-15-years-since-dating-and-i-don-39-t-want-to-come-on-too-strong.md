<p>Man I wish I had a good answer for you. It’s all over the place. There’s one girl I started going out with recently that won’t really respond if I initiate. She has to initiate, and I just have to accept whatever she throws out there.</p><p>I don’t even know what pursuing means anymore. Everything’s just so nuts.</p>
