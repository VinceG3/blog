<p>If you think carefully, existence as a concept doesn't make sense unless there's interaction. If you look at a blank canvas, nothing exists on the canvas. Once things start interacting with each other, then you can mark time according to the interactions. Time is meaningless otherwise.</p><p>So time exists when other things do.</p>
