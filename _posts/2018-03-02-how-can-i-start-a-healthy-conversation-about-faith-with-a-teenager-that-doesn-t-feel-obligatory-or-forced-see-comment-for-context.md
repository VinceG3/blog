title: How can I start a healthy conversation about faith with a teenager that doesnâ€™t feel obligatory or forced? See comment for context.

<p>You can start off with some more accessible examples of faith and belief. One I like to point to is the interaction between Clarence and Elvis in <i>True Romance</i>. The whole movie may not be appropriate to show in a class setting but you might show YouTube excerpts. Elvis as a figure in Clarence's life that gives him meaning and purpose is exactly like a personal relationship with Jesus.</p><p>You can then segue into the idea that many Christians build personal relationships with Mary or one of the saints.</p><p>Finally you can show parts of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, I recommend the recent 2009 animated version, it's fantastic and dark enough to capture the imaginations of teenagers. I would focus on the "ghosts", who always were more like angels to me. What's their role, what do they do?</p><p>The idea that kids can get divine help in the form of a spirit guide like Elvis might be really appealing to them. It might be just enough to get some of them to try.</p>
