title: Do you believe that if you are on the wrong path in life career wise, doors start closing on you?

<p>Some people really get a lot out of their career. Other people, their career is really more of a vehicle that takes them through the rest of life. Career decisions are really life decisions.</p><p>For example, I’ve made a career and life decision that I really only ever want to work with the Ruby programming language. Another one is that loyalty, harmony and safety are more important to me than excitement, opportunity and growth.</p><p>Once you’ve made one of these decisions, you can make them consciously or unconsciously, yes, doors that lead down other paths start closing. The decisions themselves aren’t really right or wrong, they’re just how you deal with things.</p><p>Sometimes the universe decides we need an adventure off the beaten path, so you’ll get an opportunity that you find yourself taking that you’d have otherwise passed on. These can be among the most fulfilling experiences of our lives.</p>
