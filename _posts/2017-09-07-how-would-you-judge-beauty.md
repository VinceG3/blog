<p>Ugh.</p><p>I try not to. Women try to convince me from time to time that beauty has objective standards. It never fails to amuse me. I’ve gathered that different cultures have different beauty standards. Rarely am I attracted to a “beauty queen.”</p><p>It gets me into a lot of trouble when I try to explain why I think every person is beautiful. I only find certain women attractive, and I make no bones about the fact that it’s a subjective judgment. But no, women trying to pump objective beauty standards out of me.</p><p>I am happy to discuss with you who I think is attractive and who I don’t think is attractive and why. I am not going to participate in a silly game of trying to rank women on their beauty.</p>
