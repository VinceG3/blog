<p>Anything you find meaning in is worth doing. All you have to do is consult your feelings and decide whether you want to explore a particular niche of existence. There’s no magic “worth sheet” in the sky that tells you whether any particular thing is worth doing or not.</p><p>I’ll say that if you’re worried whether something is worth doing or not, then that usually means that there’s something that you want to do that you’re procrastinating about that you really probably should be doing.</p><p>Or that thing that you’re worried about isn’t really all that important after all and that diving into the world of imagination is just what you need to find some fresh inspiration.</p><p>Either way I wouldn’t worry about it. Just go one way until you decide not to go that way anymore, then go a different way.</p>
