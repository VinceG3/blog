<p>Yes, the very concept of God is not something that can fit into human minds. We can only deal with God by bringing him down to human level and thinking about him in human terms.</p><p>We can consider God, but never understand him. To say he exists or doesn’t exist is to apply human logic to something that is just not subject to it.</p><p>Spirituality is the activity of trying to learn more about God. You can approach God in lots of different ways, such as ritual, meditation, or even taking a few hundred bucks to the casino and playing blackjack. God is everywhere, and nowhere. There is so much more to the question of God’s existence than a binary yes / no.</p><p>Even if you don’t believe in God, God will still play with you. Just act “as if” God exists and go a little outside your comfort zone and see if you get an interesting experience. If the conditions are right, and you give God enough space to ‘play’, he’ll give you one, even reliably.</p><p>But the second you start making demands, unless you’re what they call “blessed,” God will trip you up and you’ll fall on your face.</p>
