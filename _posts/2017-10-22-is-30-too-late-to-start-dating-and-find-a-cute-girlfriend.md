<p>Ha! I started dating a few years ago. I'm 34 now. I actually recommend sitting your twenties out if you can. Get settled in a career first. Worry about your love life after you get your <b>you</b> life handled.</p><p>Every girl I date is prettier than the last. If I keep this up, I'll be dating movie stars by next year.</p>
