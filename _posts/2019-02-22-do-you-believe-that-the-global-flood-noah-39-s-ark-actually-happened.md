<p>This is the Iron Age we’re talking about. The people in the Iron Age didn’t even have telescopes. When they say their world was drowned in a big flood, we don’t need to ascribe our modern technological omniscience, we can just take them for what they meant, instead of our literal interpretations from our modern perspective.</p><p>Their whole world was drowned in a flood. Any other interpretation is just silliness. Large regions have flooded before. It will probably happen again.</p>
