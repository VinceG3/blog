<p>You can have faith in people. You can have faith in your government. You can have faith in your country. You can have faith in the fact that everything usually turns out alright. You can have faith in your abilities. You can have faith in President Obama. (arguable about the current Prez) You can have faith in the Force. You can have faith in the Atlanta Braves.</p><p>You can have faith in math. You can have faith in democracy. You can have faith in Nikola Tesla. You can have faith in your career field. You can have faith that your cat is going to be just fine out there in the neighborhood. You can have faith in humanity. You can have faith in the European Union. You can have faith that no matter what happens, you’ll pull through.</p><p>Faith is way bigger than ‘mere’ belief.</p>
