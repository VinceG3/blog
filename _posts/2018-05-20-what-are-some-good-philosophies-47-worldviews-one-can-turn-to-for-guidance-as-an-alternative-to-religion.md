<p>Stoicism is pretty good, and deep. Zen isn't bad either, but doesn't really offer much in the way of guidance. But search yourself and ask what it is about belief that turns you off so much. Because when it comes to keeping your mind from naturally disengaging and losing focus, it's really hard to beat belief.</p><p>If you want something that's going to grab hold of you and never let go, that does all the heavy lifting for you, well, Christianity has been at that game for two thousand years. It's really good at it.</p>
