title: Why did people believe Jesus Christ was the Son of God?

<p>Because it’s fundamental to the lesson Christianity is aiming to teach. The religion just doesn’t work otherwise.</p><p>Christianity split off from Judaism, whose scripture told the stories of many similarly holy men and their relationship with the Lord. Christians believe that the lessons of the Old Testament are just that, old. Instead they want the promise of ultimate salvation and forgiveness.</p><p>Ultimate salvation can’t come from a man, it has to come from God. The bringer and teacher of those lessons has to be worthy of bringing and teaching them, so the idea of Jesus being God just fits.</p>
