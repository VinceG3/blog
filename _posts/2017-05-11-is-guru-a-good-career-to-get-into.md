<p>Oh good lord no. If you think about it, it’s basically a service job. People look to you for answers and insight and entertainment, and you have to weave all three together and still convince them to pay you for it, because strangely, people will pay for entertainment by itself, they’ll pay for answers or insight by themselves, but put them all together and it’s like you’ve gone magically into no-money land. So get used to those ramen noodles because you’re going to be eating them for awhile.</p><p>If you’re a genius like Rajneesh was, then you can get your followers to give you anything you want. But Rajneesh existed in a very special time period, when Americans had tons of money to spend and not a lot of interesting things to spend it on. Wasn’t very hard to get them to buy him a hundred or so Rolls Royces. Yeah good luck with that.</p><p>If it’s something that you <b>have</b> to do, it’s your path and passion, then knock yourself out, but if you’ve got any choice at all as to what you do with your time, then being someone’s spiritual vehicle is a very poor one.</p>
