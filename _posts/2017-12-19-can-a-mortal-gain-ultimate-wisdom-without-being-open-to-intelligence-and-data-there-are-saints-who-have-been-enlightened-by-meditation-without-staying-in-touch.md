<p>Enlightenment does not give you any kind of ultimate wisdom. And intelligence and data does not give it to you either. The errors made by enlightened sages are legion. It does not make them unenlightened nor does it make them not worth listening to.</p><p>Not all truth is scientific, it can be allegorical as well. The key to understanding and gaining value from allegory is to simply imagine a world in which what theyâ€™re saying is actually true. Then you can start thinking about why. Literally ignore the science, if only for the purposes of that one idea.</p>
