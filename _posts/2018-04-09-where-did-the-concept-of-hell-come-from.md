title: Where did the concept of hell come from?

<p>The Wikipedia page on Hell articulates an interesting fact: that religions that define a cyclical history depict Hell as an intermediate place you go to in between incarnations, whereas those with a linear history depict Hell as eternal.</p><p>Being that religions are largely vehicles of social control, the idea seems to stem from the need to motivate people to get along. Roasting away in Hell forever is a powerful motivator.</p>
