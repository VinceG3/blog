<p>It means he’s being super-dramatic and you get the unenviable task of trying to take him with just the right amount of seriousness.</p><p>He doesn’t think he deserves to be with you. This normally isn’t a problem, but guys who express these sorts of feelings in such a melodramatic way have ways of turning them into self-fulfilling prophecies.</p><p>And there’s not a whole lot you can do about it. Guys get into this mental state a lot where they have feelings of inadequacy that they <i>think</i> that you could solve for them, but really they are rooted in his psyche and since you’re not a psychologist, you can’t exactly go rooting around in there looking for things to fix. His road to absolution from his self-torture is going to be long and hard.</p><p>I’m not saying you should dump him, but you should consider taking him at his word.</p>
