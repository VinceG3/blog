<p>You have not specified your education level. If you expect to have a college degree by the time you look for work, then it does not matter what your skill set actually is, you can apply for any kind of programming job and at least get consideration.</p><p>If you are trying to break into the field without a degree, then the next best thing to do is to go to code school. You’re going to want to do a little research here to figure out the best one to attend. If you can finance tuition I’d consider that a good deal. Here you want to focus on the web because that’s where all the jobs are.</p><p>If you don’t expect to have a degree and don’t want to go to code school for whatever reason, then stick to the web because the demand is such that companies really drop their standards. Other fields don’t have nearly the same demand so they are way pickier about who they hire. It’s a steeper learning curve but that’s why you have the opportunity.</p>
