<p>Of course not. Why in the world would I? You either enjoy a mystical lifestyle or you don’t. And even if you do enjoy one, there’s no guarantee that you’d enjoy talking about it. And if you do enjoy talking about it, then the conversation will naturally turn that way. No point at all in forcing a conversation with someone on a topic they don’t enjoy.</p>
