<p>Grace is what God gives everyone, regardless of worth or whether they’ve earned it. What most people don’t realize is that <b>asking</b> for gifts, from the bottom of our beings, earns us far more than ‘mere’ grace.</p><p>Self-reliance can earn us more grace. But the willingness to ask God, to ask Christ, for more than ‘mere’ grace is in itself worth something. You need to walk with God if you really want more out of God than His grace. If you’re not willing to walk with God, then just do whatever you do and maybe God will gift you anyway.</p><p>Sure, God helps those who help themselves. But He can only help them as far as their wisdom will allow. How do you earn more wisdom? It’s right there at the beginning of Proverbs. Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</p><p>You must fear God if you want to be wise. Be willing to accept His chastising. For God only chastises those He cares about.</p>
