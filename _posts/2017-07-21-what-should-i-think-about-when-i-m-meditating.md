title: What should I think about when I’m meditating?

<p>When I was first getting started, my teacher had me use visualization techniques. I carried on doing visualization meditations on and off for another 10 or so years.</p><p>The most basic one is the apple meditation. Picture an apple in front of you. See how red it is, how shiny it is. If your apple is green, or polka-dot, that’s fine, no big deal. See your apple in front of it.</p><p>Now imagine you reaching out and taking the apple into your hand. Feel the shiny skin of the apple. Feel your mouth salivating at the thought of eating it.</p><p>Bite into the apple. Feel the crunch of the flesh. Taste the juiciness. Feel it run down your face. Take another bite.</p><p>Keep taking bites of the apple until you have nothing left but the core.</p><p>Do this every day for a couple of weeks, then try other meditations. Leave a comment if you want some ideas.</p>
