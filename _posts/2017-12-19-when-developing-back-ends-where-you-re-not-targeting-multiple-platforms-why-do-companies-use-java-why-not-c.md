title: When developing back ends, where youâ€™re not targeting multiple platforms, why do companies use Java? Why not C++?

<p>The main reason people use Java over C++ is because C++ has historically been really really hard, and business backends all mostly look the same, so you could use a Java framework and not have to maintain a C++ one. Java bakes in a lot of safety directly into the platform.</p>
