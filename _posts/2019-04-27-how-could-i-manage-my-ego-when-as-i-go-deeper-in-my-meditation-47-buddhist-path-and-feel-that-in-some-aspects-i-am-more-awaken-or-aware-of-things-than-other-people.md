title: How could I “manage” my ego when as I go deeper in my meditation&#47;Buddhist path and feel that in some aspects I am more “awaken” or aware of things than other people?

<p>The way I have found that works best for dealing with my ego is to show it love and allow it to participate in the process. This way I get a more fuller spiritual experience.</p><p>Ego is funny, it trips and gets hung up on things because it can only see them one way. Let it do that. Don’t try to pull back on the feelings, charge forward. “I’m not just more aware, I’m <i>superaware,</i> I can’t believe they won’t put me in a Marvel movie because of my enlightened superpowers. I’m like a 4,000,000 on the awesome scale!” And so the silliness collapses in on itself rather than running around in your brain creating doubt.</p><p>It’s also good to recognize what the ego feelings are really hiding, and that is loneliness. You’re noticing that it’s difficult to share spiritual experiences with people. It would be good to find one person to confide with.</p>
