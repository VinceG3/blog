<p><a href="/profile/Red-Subijano">Red Subijano</a> makes an excellent point when she says that like 99% of those who were offended were white. One of the subtle ways that racism still persists in this country is being over-PC to the point to where you’re drowning out the voices of people actually being oppressed.</p><p>Being told that you were offended rather than having the option to actually get offended or not is pretty much the total opposite of empowerment.</p><p>We don’t lynch people anymore, minorities don’t need White Knights riding in to do battle for them. If you see some racist shit, the best thing to do is to just go stand with the person getting shit on and lend quiet support.</p>
