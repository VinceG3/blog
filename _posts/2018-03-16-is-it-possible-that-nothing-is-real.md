<p>A fun thing to do is to walk around and say in your head to everything you see, “this is not real.” These books are not real, this monitor is not real. My keyboard isn’t real. My desk isn’t real.</p><p>Do this continuously whenever you remember for a few days. It does fun things to your brain. I’d especially recommend giving it a shot if you’re depressed.</p>
