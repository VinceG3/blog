<p>You need to come to a full understanding of why you had the earlier behavior that you’re now trying to change. Then you need to defeat your earlier behavior in detail.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Defeat in detail - Wikipedia</a></p><p>Normally when armies clash, it lasts long enough to rout one side. Basically they just turn tail and run. This satisfies your short-term goals, but leaves your enemy alive to fight another day. Destroy their entire army, however, and they can’t.</p><p>In order to apply this to behavior change, you need to see the behavior you’re trying to change as a collection of smaller things, each of which can be attacked and eliminated.</p><p>For example, if you’re trying to eat better, you can make a catalog of all the different ways you eat, and make sure you have better options for each of those scenarios. Then it becomes a matter of tactics and discipline rather than strategy.</p>
