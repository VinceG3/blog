title: How will an enlightened or self realized person feel when he is fired from his job?

<p>I have been fired various times from jobs in the past. The reaction is usually elation. I can now find something else to do as the universe released me from this one. Once the dust settles I looked back on the previous events and saw the chain of events that led up to it.</p><p>I look at the physical world as a mere extension of the spiritual. All this stuff is here, but it’s no more real than anything else. A job is just a way for spiritual reality to reveal itself to me. Watching the shifting, the reorienting, the reflection. Getting hung up on egos, and then releasing, the resulting whiplash dislodging the ego elements.</p><p>The job came from God, and it returned to God when the time came. The last thing I would have wanted was to hold onto that job when God has so much more planned.</p><p>It’s the same with the job as it is with life. I could give all this, my body, my mind, my life, up tomorrow and wouldn’t regret or change a thing. Because I am not any of these things, they belong to God. It is a gift to receive them, and a gift to be able to release them.</p>
