<p>I think it’s great and I hope the rules of sexual harassment in the workplace become more and more explicit and that it becomes the new normal in America. The last thing I want as a man is to make anyone, particularly someone I’m attracted to, uncomfortable.</p><p>I want women I’m attracted to to be comfortable with me. That way if they are also attracted to me, they feel like they can safely approach me so we can interact and build up a friendship. I hate the awkward ground between people where you just don’t know how to approach initiating any sort of non-work-related interaction.</p><p>If rules can be laid out and made normal, then it could prove to actually make workplace romances <i>more</i> common, not less.</p>
