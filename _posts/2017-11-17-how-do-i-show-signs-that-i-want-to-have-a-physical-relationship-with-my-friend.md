<p>If you just want to “show signs”, then you don't have to do anything special, you probably already are.</p><p>If you want to actually have a relationship with your friend, you need to nut up and<b> tell</b> them. With words. That you speak out of your mouth. That actually, literally says to them, that you like them and want to explore a relationship together.</p><p>Get that? Words. That you say. Words. Not signs.</p>
