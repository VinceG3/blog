<p>My father yelled at, controlled, and slept around on my mother. He bought a car with a standard transmission and wouldn’t teach her how to drive it. When she finally decided she needed to go to the store and she was going to drive it anyway, she ran into him cheating on her in the parking lot.</p><p>It wasn’t until I was around four that she finally did something about it. Just decided one day that enough was enough, damn the consequences. She cycled through boyfriends for a few years before meeting my stepdad. Being a single mother in South Louisiana in the eighties wasn’t fun. She had stalkers, horrible jobs, men that pretended to be her friends.</p><p>Everybody has to make the decision of what is enough and when is that point reached. I don’t want to tell you that that point is right here right now, but every minute you spend in a relationship that doesn’t make you happy robs you of another minute of happiness. It might take you years to find it, but you can’t do it while you’re shacked up with a guy you don’t love.</p>
