title: You see a person eating alone. You know that you won&#39;t like making conversation with them, and you suspect that sitting with them once might make them think you will continue to do so. What do you do, and why do you decide to do it?

<p>I eat alone a lot. I’m a single guy. I’m used to eating alone. I don’t need your company. If I needed company, I’d call up one of my buddies.</p><p>If you came and sat down next to me, then unless you’re female and I’m actually attracted to you, then this is going to get awkward fast. Because it’ll be me thinking that you’re the lonely one.</p><p>If you see a guy who is obviously lonely, like he’s trying to make small talk with the person behind the counter, and you actually want to talk to them, knock yourself out. But don’t assume that someone is actually lonely just because they’re by themselves.</p><p>This goes quadruple if the person is female.</p>
