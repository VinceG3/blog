title: Why isn&#39;t the red pill of reality the same as enlightenment?

<p>Taking the red pill didn’t make Neo enlightened. Neo’s journey only began with the red pill, it could never have ended with it.</p><p>The process of becoming enlightened has nothing to do with knowledge. No amount or kind of knowledge can make you enlightened, no particular attitude about the world that would come from that knowledge.</p><p>Nothing about the world can do anything but point to the truth within. It is within you go to find enlightenment. The adventures you have when you can see what others can’t, these are the things that make it possible to earn power and understanding. But these things and abilities are not enlightenment.</p><p>Enlightenment is when you gain enough wisdom from the process to be able to <i>stop fighting</i>.</p>
