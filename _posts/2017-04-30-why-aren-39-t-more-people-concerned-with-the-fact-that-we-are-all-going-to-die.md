<p>I’ve often wondered about this and where I landed on it is that our brains just won’t let us think about it for very long. Either you find a religious solution for it and move on, you accept the materialist solution and move on, or you just stop thinking about it.</p><p>Existential angst is a source of distress, and comes with an easy, in-built solution, stop thinking about it.</p>
