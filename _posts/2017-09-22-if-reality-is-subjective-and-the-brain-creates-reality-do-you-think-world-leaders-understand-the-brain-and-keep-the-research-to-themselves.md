title: If reality is subjective and the brain creates reality, do you think world leaders understand the brain and keep the research to themselves?

<p>No. World leaders have a certain perspective that comes from learning how to lead people. This perspective can be acquired by getting a manager’s job at your local fast food joint. More than that you just can’t generalize.</p><p>You’d think the President of the United States, leader of the most powerful country on the face of the planet, would be far more informed and capable than anyone else, but Trump put the lie to that pretty quick. He won’t even listen to his daily security briefings, briefings I’d absolutely kill to sit in on.</p><p>Turns out even if you have access to everything, you still have to read and digest and learn. Even if the research actually exists, it takes time and effort to learn it, more time to internalize it, more time still to master it and come up with real strategies that incorporate it. And time is the one thing that no one can hoard, not even world leaders.</p><p>You can lead the world’s most powerful horse to water, but you can’t make the sad orange sack drink.</p>
