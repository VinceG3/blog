title: What makes truth universally true?

<p>Truth is not universally true. Truth is <i>contextually</i> true.</p><p>Is the statement “John is alive” still true if John gets hit by the proverbial bus? No, the statement remains true only so long as John actually remains alive. Then it becomes false.</p><p>I have a word for things that do not lose their truth depending on the context. I call it <i>absolute</i>. The easiest absolute thing I can point to is math. Something like 1+1=2 is true in all contexts. Naturally, the ideas of equivalence, whole numbers, and addition are interesting, deep topics, but actual arithmetic equations are absolute.</p>
