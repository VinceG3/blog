title: Is suffering essential for a spiritual awakening?

<p>My interest in the topic of spiritual awakening has flagged a bit, I had mine so very long ago, and really, my life has been one, long, slow, continuous awakening, so the idea that it can happen all of a sudden seems to me to be more on the wishful side of things.</p><p>In my mind, you study, practice, meditate, engage, pursue, search, and then one day it just happens. Mine was really interesting and rather spectacular, maybe one day I’ll write a book about it, but it was for <i>me</i>. I have a weird mind that works a weird way, and my awakening weirdly catered to my weird need to understand weird things. It’s hard to relate back to ordinary people, and really, that’s kind of the point.</p><p>I’ll tell you what it didn’t involve. Suffering. Suffering can be spiritual, but suffering isn’t <i>inherently</i> spiritual. Nothing is, really, except God Himself.</p>
