<p>Anybody going into Buddhism thinking it’s going to be instantly compatible with a Westernized, materialistic frame is going to be sorely disappointed. Most Buddhist traditions teach of reincarnation, and reincarnation just doesn’t work without souls.</p><p>You choose how you want to deal with it. Do me a favor, at one point, while you’re hard at work converting to your brand new Eastern spiritual tradition, think back and ask yourself why you couldn’t do this with something closer to home.</p>
