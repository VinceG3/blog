title: How do you connect to attractive yet shallow women?

<p>I’ve dated a few shallow women, and this is a problem that never goes away. You want to talk about deeper things but they only will ever have a surface-level appreciation for those things.</p><p>Making a relationship work involves figuring out how to get what you need from this person while figuring out how to give them what they need.</p><p>With someone that is shallow, you have to dumb everything down. Say things that come off the top of your head with very little filter. <i>Especially</i> if it’s risque or a little weird. She’ll find it hilarious.</p>
