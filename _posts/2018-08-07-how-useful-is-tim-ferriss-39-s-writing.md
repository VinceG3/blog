<p>I’d say it’s useful as an aspirational tool for most, to offer a kind of “North Star” that you can guide yourself with. That’s worth a lot, in and of itself.</p><p>It’s been more useful than that to the people who chose to follow in Tim’s footsteps. I wouldn’t want to try to estimate how many people that is.</p><p>If you’re wanting to know whether reading it will be useful to you, then that’s a question that can only be answered by reading it and trying it out. Some people, like me, did that and decided to go another way.</p>
