<p>The belief business is fun because you can choose to be whatever you want. The Bible can be interpreted a million different ways. Whatever you want to be, you can find a way to find acceptance and understanding in the Bible.</p><p>You got the God business all wrong. Jesus just wants you to love others and live in peace and harmony. Aside from that, you can be <b>whoever you want to be</b>.</p>
