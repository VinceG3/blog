<p>You just walk up to them and talk to them.</p><p>Introversion is not shyness. Introverts are often shy, but shyness is something you can work on, whereas all attempts to ‘work’ on your introversion end up only solidifying it. This is because shyness is a personality <i>defect</i>, whereas introversion is a personality <i>trait</i>. Defects remove possibility, while traits enhance it.</p><p>You should read a few books on introversion. The one I liked the most was <i>The Introvert Advantage</i>.</p><p>Shy people are afraid of social interaction, introverts would just prefer to be doing something else. The introvert can override this preference whenever he wants for any reason they choose. A shy person cannot override it because they’re just too afraid.</p><p>When I go out of my way to talk to females, I find that it stresses me out a lot and I need to structure a lot of alone time around it. It’s something I only do if I’m really lonely. I am normally not lonely so I never feel compelled to do it.</p><p>Many times, I prefer the feeling of loneliness to the energy drain engendered by social interaction. Sometimes I prefer the energy drain. It’s all in what I want to experience at any given time.</p>
