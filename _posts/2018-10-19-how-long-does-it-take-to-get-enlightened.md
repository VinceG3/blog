title: How long does it take to get enlightened?

<p>I asked and got “around 7000 lifetimes.”</p><p>At some point you have to define what it is to be human. Your 7000 starts once that milestone is hit. Then you spend a few thousand lifetimes acclimating to being human. Then you finally start learning the finer points of wisdom and intellect. Eventually you’ll start getting interested in spirituality and find the goal of enlightenment. Around 50 lifetimes is needed from that point.</p><p>Once you become enlightened then the next major goal is transcending humanity, or at least, our conceptualization of what it means to be a person. 10,000 lifetimes is the answer I’m getting for that. At some point in those 10,000, life and death slowly lose meaning. So you’re not dying and getting reborn but rather holding on to the same ‘vehicle’.</p>
