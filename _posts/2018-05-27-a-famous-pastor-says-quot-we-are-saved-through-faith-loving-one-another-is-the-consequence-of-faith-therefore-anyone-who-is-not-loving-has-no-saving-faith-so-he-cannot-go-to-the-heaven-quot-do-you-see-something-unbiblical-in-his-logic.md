title: A famous pastor says, &quot;We are saved through faith. Loving one another is the consequence of faith. Therefore, anyone who is not loving has no saving faith, so he cannot go to the heaven.&quot; Do you see something unbiblical in his logic?

<p>People can still have faith and not be loving. Faith only is required to find Heaven. Nothing else. Someone may have a emotional disturbance keeping them from having the "right" emotions or displaying them in the "right" way.</p><p>A person's relationship with Christ is their own, it's not a matter of public recognition.</p>
