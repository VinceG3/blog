title: Why do questions about atheism always seem to create so much interaction?

<p>Atheism was a hot-button topic 20 years ago when I was first getting online. Seemed like every 15 year old punk with an ax to grind found religion an easy target. God is the easiest punching bag adolescence can find.</p><p>Over the following decade people just slowly stopped being interested in the debate. The punks just couldn’t find any theists to pile on to, they pretty much left the Internet en masse. Many forums just became atheist echo chambers. Yours truly sought out more diverse places to have discussions where it wasn’t just a bunch of angry kids.</p><p>Then the Internet started civilizing, and ordinary people started contributing on the new, massive social media platforms. The old atheism-theism debate is new again, being perpetuated by people who just aren’t aware of the last twenty years of history.</p><p>The demand for Advertiser Friendly Content is keeping debates from getting too heated, but what drives a person to choose a position is deep-seated, and not really accessible rationally. Therefore no discussion will ever convince someone to abandon their position. But that won’t stop anyone from trying.</p>
