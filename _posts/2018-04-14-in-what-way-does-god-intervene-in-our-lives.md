<p>God doesn’t fuck around. He’ll put you right on the brink of ruin, then deliver you from cataclysm through a ridiculous sequence of events that leaves you staggered and humbled. You won’t have anyone else to pin it on <b>but</b> God.</p><p>Sadly, writing these stories out takes Lots Of Words. The accounts that don’t take lots of words, “God saved my baby from getting run over by sending a man to walk by at that very moment,” are also easy to disclaim as not the work of God and rather random chance.</p><p>No, what made it the work of God was the fact that the mother had been going through some very spiritually trying times and the dad left them and the event in question not only saved their daughter, but their relationship and by extension, blessed their whole lives.</p><p>A fluke is just that, a fluke. When it’s God, you <b>know</b>.</p>
