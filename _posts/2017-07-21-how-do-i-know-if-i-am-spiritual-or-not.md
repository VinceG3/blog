<p>Everybody’s spiritual, it’s just a question of labeling.</p><p>Spirituality is anything that tries to get at the underlying nature of being. God is but one part of it. Anything one can do can be looked at as a spiritual exercise. Even things like drugs and sex. Especially sex.</p><p>Science? Deeply spiritual. Most atheists don’t realize that the first scientists were all highly religious, in many cases actual ordained clergy. It was religion that provided mankind with the impetus to develop clock technology.</p><p>One of the more common spiritual activities I see these days that people don’t think is spiritual is reading science fiction. It makes you think a lot about what could be, what might be.</p><p>It’s silly to think that any particular activity is ‘more’ spiritual than any other. Instead it’s best to think about it in terms of just how much of oneself you give to that activity. When you pour your heart and soul into something, you learn things and it changes you. That’s the essence of spiritual growth.</p><p>About the only thing I can think of that isn’t spiritual is just floating around doing noting. Wait a minute, that’s called meditation!</p>
