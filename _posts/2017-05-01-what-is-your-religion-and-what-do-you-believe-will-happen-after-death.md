title: What is your religion, and what do you believe will happen after death?
date: 2017-05-01

<p>I don’t adhere to a religion, but I’m fairly spiritual. I believe in souls, reincarnation, spiritual growth, and enlightenment. If you’re enlightened you can choose to reincarnate or not. Spend enough time enlightened and you can’t really tell whether you’re alive or not. I’m not entirely sure what will happen when I die. Will I go back to my ‘home’ in the space between worlds or will I just hop into a new body?</p><p>I’m hoping to avoid the question for awhile by becoming immortal. I’m rooting for life extension technology and plan to get cryogenically preserved if it’s not ready by the time I get too old. I’m not afraid of death but I really enjoy life so I’d like to keep that going as long as I can.</p>
