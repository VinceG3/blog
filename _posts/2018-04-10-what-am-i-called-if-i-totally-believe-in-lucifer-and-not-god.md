<p>I would call you silly.</p><p>Did you just make up your own deity and call it Lucifer? If not then you had to get your ideas of what Lucifer is, what he stands for, and what his purpose for you is from somewhere. Since you haven’t stated this information, I can only assume that you mean the figure of Abrahamic religions. As there is no Abrahamic religion without God, you’re just being silly.</p>
