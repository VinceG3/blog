title: How do you know if someone is emotionally available?

<p>Emotional availability leads to vulnerability, and vulnerability can lead to the prospect that a person might need to change their ways. When someone is unavailable, that means they are unwilling to invest <i>themselves</i> into the relationship, meaning that they aren’t willing to change at all to suit the needs of the relationship and the other person.</p><p>So you know when someone is available for a relationship when they a) admit that something they did was wrong, and b) change something as a result of it. This means they’re interested in a real relationship, that they’re willing to be an equal participant in it.</p><p>And it can be very easy to miss if you don’t specifically look for it.</p>
