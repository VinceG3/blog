<p>A few years ago I used to keep a journal with things I wanted. As things manifested I’d cross them off the list. Every day I’d spend some time forming the intention and releasing it out into the world.</p><p>I eventually stopped when I realized that all the organization wasn’t really helping, all that stuff happened for me before I started writing it down and meditating, and it would keep happening after I stopped.</p><p>It’s a good exercise to do to get a feel for what the universe brings into your world and how.</p><p>I knew a guy who was way more hardcore about it than I was. He was a millionaire legal consultant in Singapore, who regularly manifested millions of dollars.</p><p>The realization that I wouldn’t trade my life for his marked the end of my interest in magick.</p>
