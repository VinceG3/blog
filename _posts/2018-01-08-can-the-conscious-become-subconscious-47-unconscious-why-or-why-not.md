title: Can the conscious become subconscious&#47;unconscious? Why or why not?

<p>I found the best metaphor for understanding how the conscious works is as a light being flashed over the rest of your mind. There are areas that the light never hits, this is what we call the subconscious. Things in your subconscious can suddenly become conscious, and things can subside from the conscious mind and fall into the parts where the light never flashes.</p><p>In fact, everything we typically call “subconscious” consists of old, old patterns that you’ve long forgotten about but used to be at the very forefront of mind. If you’re unreasonably afraid of spiders, and can’t think of the reason why, that reason is buried deep in the subconscious, and it’s very likely a dream or actual experience you had with spiders that was so horrid to your young self that you held on to it through adulthood, even if the actual experience was forgotten.</p><p>If conscious elements never became unconscious then life would quickly become unmanageable.</p>
