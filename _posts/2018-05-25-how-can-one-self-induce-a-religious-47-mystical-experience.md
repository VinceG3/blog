<p>Sit in quiet contemplation of the divine. Keep sitting. Don’t get up, and don’t let your mind wander. If your mind wanders, gently return your thoughts to the divine. Sit like this for at least 10 minutes. Do this at least once every day until it happens.</p><p>There’s Buddhist terminology that might be helpful here. Access concentration is when your mind stops wandering. Jhana states are the rather pronounced mystical states that your mind goes through. Even the first jhana can feel immensely mystical, especially if you practice it. But somewhere around 8 can be identified, and it’s around the third or fourth where thought forms start arising of their own volition from deep in mind. This is mystical experience.</p><p>The thing being focused on in the beginning is called the ‘object’. When your object is Jesus, it’s called prayer, and the nature of the experience will have Christian themes.</p>
