<p>Weird A2A. Please don’t enlist me to do your cyber-stalking for you.</p><p>The first thing to do is a Google Image search. In Chrome, this is accomplished by right-clicking (or control-click on mac) and selecting “Search Google for Image”. The given URL appears to be from an e-commerce site. The Google search confirms that she’s modeling for one of the many retailers selling their products on Ali Express.</p><p><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2016-New-children-lingerie-Kids-Girls-Lingerie-Cotton-Lingerie-Brassiere-sets-girl-Breathable-Bra-lingerie-Bra/32640078739.html" data-qt-tooltip="aliexpress.com">2016 New children lingerie Kids Girls Lingerie Cotton Lingerie Brassiere sets girl Breathable Bra lingerie Bra Girls Sets-in Bras from Mother &amp; Kids on Aliexpress.com | Alibaba Group</a></p><p>As most of the retailers are Chinese, they probably contracted out the product modeling to a third party, likely based in the US. She’s a private model and probably doesn’t need your stalking unless you’re looking to book her. If that’s the case, I’d suggest finding out who exactly retails that product, then emailing them to find out who they contracted out to. Then contact her agency with further inquiries.</p>
