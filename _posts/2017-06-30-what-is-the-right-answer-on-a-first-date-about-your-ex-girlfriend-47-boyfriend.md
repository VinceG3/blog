<p>To piggyback on what <a href="/profile/Franklin-Veaux">Franklin Veaux</a> is saying, a relationship is supposed to change you, you don’t want to be the same person coming out of a relationship that you were going into it. So the best way to talk about it is to describe it in terms of the lessons you learned.</p><p>You never want to make it about your ex. The person you’re sitting with is thinking about starting up a romance with <i>you</i>, not your ex, so make it about you. Don’t toot your own horn but don’t sell yourself short either.</p><p>So be open and honest about your feelings.</p><p>I know what a lot of people are going to say to this, “well, what if my feelings are ugly and stupid, do I really want to be so negative?”</p><p>Well, this is where the change part comes in. You are supposed to have already figured out the lessons. If you learn something from a bad experience, then the bad experience gets transformed into a good story, and you get transformed into a better person. Telling good stories is always a good date strategy. Especially if those stories give this other person a good idea of what it would be like to date you.</p>
