title: Can you describe God?

<p>The word I’ve been meditating on lately with reference to God is <i>majesty</i>. The sheer utter majesty of God is such that nothing, nothing at all, nothing remotely conceivable, is inconsequential. Everything is relevant in the eyes of the Lord, and He will show, demonstrate, and explain that relevance to you should you ever chance upon the ability to allow His words to reach you.</p><p>Imagine having a kingdom, with all your little minions doing your bidding. Ask yourself this, why are those minions doing your bidding? Let me paint a picture of actual minions, one perfectly relevant to this discussion:</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72f959748ebf9f1052292c6592c7fdfa.webp"><p>Why do they follow Gru? Two main reasons. First, they’re happy to do so, building and engineering gives them meaning in their lives. Second, because it’s the only life they know. They’d stick together, leaderless, rudderless, if they didn’t have Gru’s guidance. Gru only adds to their lives, even when he’s punishing them, chastising them for failing him, Gru still loves them, and they him.</p><p>It’s a perfect illustration of divine majesty. Everything fits together like a massive puzzle, bigger than you could possibly imagine, more majestic than you ever imagined could be possible.</p>
