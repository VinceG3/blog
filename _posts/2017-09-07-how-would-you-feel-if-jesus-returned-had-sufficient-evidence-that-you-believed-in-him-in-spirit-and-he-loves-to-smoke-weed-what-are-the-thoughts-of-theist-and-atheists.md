title: How would you feel if Jesus returned, had sufficient evidence that you believed in him in spirit, and he loves to smoke weed? What are the thoughts of theist and atheists?

<p>I’d be a little curious as to which laws of our world he broke in order to have his evidence. Did he just materialize out of thin air or was he born? What was it like up in Heaven? If I threw a party, could he bring the wine? (leave the weed, it’s not allowed at my apartment and I hate the smell anyway)</p><p>Which Jesus is he? Is he the one the Romans beheaded, the fiery revolutionary that wanted to throw the Romans out of Judea? Or is he the mellowed out version that the Romans later decided he was? Maybe he just figured the Romans were right? Not much of a savior then, is he?</p>
