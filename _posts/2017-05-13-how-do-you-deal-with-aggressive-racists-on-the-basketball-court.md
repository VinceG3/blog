<p>If you really want to shut it down, you have to 1) challenge them in a very entertaining way, then 2) be cool about it whether you win or lose.</p><p>So for 1, find the biggest, baddest guy there, challenge him to one on one,</p><p>For 2, play your best and bump fists with him whether you win or lose.</p><p>99% of racism is just nobody knows how to deal with the outsider. This course of action takes you from being outsider to someone who at least cares about being in the group. That matters more to them than you would think. Most people donâ€™t care.</p>
