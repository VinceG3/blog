title: What would a 5 dimensional being look like if we could even perceive it?

<p>It was recently reported that human neurons organize into structures with as many as 11 dimensions. They used the mathematical field of <i>algebraic topology</i> to analyze the networks that the neurons formed.</p><p>Increasing the dimension of a graph vastly increases the amount of information the graph can hold and convey. And there are tens of millions of these structures in a tiny spec of the brain, 86 billion neurons in total.</p><p>I think it does nature a grave disservice by saying we exist ‘merely’ in three dimensions, if thought itself is multidimensional, and we live mostly as thought.</p>
