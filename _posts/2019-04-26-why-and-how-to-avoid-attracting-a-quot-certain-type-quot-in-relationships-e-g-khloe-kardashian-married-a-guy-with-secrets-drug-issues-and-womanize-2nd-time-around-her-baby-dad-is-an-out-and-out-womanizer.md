<p>Largely our romantic preferences stem from childhood. An absent father is the biggest problem most people have in this direction. If you don’t have a positive male role model growing up as a girl, then you won’t know what to look for in a partner, so you’ll fall back to your mammalian / reptilian instincts, which is to pick a strong “bad boy” as these types are biologically more likely to survive and be able to provide for offspring. For guys it’s the porn star hip to waist ratio and curves that draws them in every time, these are genetic markers of fertility. You’re programmed to be attracted to these things, and absent of anybody to tell you otherwise, that’s what you’ll want.</p><p>The Kardashians can get away with it because they’re rich and no one marriage is going to break them, so they’re free to chase what their reptilian brains want all day long, immature but sexy professional sports stars. They spent their entire childhoods paying all the attention they could possibly spend on sports, you really expect them to have good relationship skills?</p><p>The good news is, it doesn’t have to stay this way. You can learn through experience and study what a bad match is likely to look like for you and cut off the relationships before abuse central sets in. You can read books chock full of helpful frames and advice to place this stuff in. One of my favorite paradigms that I don’t consider nearly as often as I should is that of is the love-avoidant / love-addict frame:</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d31525eb11b5725cb2810e54e5abc740"><p>If you study this stuff enough and relate it to your life and try to see the hard truths about yourself that you don’t want to see, then you can learn to have a great relationship with someone that you’re perfectly suited for.</p><p>Or you can just play out the same patterns over and over again because you’re not engaging the one capacity of yours that could possibly fix it for you.</p>
