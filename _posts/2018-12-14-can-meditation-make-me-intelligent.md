title: Can meditation make me intelligent?

<p>Meditation doesn’t have just one effect, and what you get out of it largely depends on what you’re capable of putting into it. I’ve seen people who could maintain empty-mind for hours, I’ve seen people who could only last seconds. Everybody’s mind is different, and so everyone is going to respond to meditation differently.</p><p>It’s certainly possible for meditation to remove mental blocks so that you can operate in the mundane world faster and more lucidly. Whether it will do that to <i>you</i> when <i>you</i> meditate is up in the air.</p>
