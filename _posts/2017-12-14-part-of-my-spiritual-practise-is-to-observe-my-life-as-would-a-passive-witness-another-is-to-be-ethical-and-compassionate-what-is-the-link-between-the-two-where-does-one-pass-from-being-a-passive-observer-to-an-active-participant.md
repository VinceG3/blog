title: Part of my spiritual practise is to observe my life as would a passive witness, another is to be ethical and compassionate. What is the link between the two? Where does one pass from being a passive observer to an active participant?

<p>I really like this question. Not so much because I actually have a useful answer, I don’t really, but because I like where your head is at. Taking two seemingly disparate practices and trying to merge them is like the holy grail of spirituality.</p><p>In this case watching vs. acting. What I like to do personally is to merge by not merging. Watch when I feel like watching, and act when I feel like acting. There is plenty of time and space when you’re not watching or acting, that’s prime time to <i>reflect</i>. Go back over your earlier existences and reactions and actions and ask yourself how you could have done better. Keep asking yourself questions and see how deep you can go.</p><p>Eventually you’ll start to act naturally in ways that reflect your watchful state. The distance will close and you’ll be able to exercise both aspects of yourself simultaneously.</p>
