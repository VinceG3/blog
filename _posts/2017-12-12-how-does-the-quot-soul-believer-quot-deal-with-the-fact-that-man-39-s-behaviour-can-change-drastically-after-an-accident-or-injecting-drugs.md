title: How does the &quot;soul believer&quot; deal with the fact that man&#39;s behaviour can change drastically after an accident or injecting drugs?

<p>This particular soul believer is not impressed by your question. The soul can easily evade your silly logic. Man’s behavior changes drastically after he eats a good meal, perhaps not so drastically as a brain injury or mind-altering drugs, but fairly drastic nonetheless.</p><p>And just you try to get in the way of his food. You might get to witness the most amazing transformation of them all, a normally-sensible and civilized human being into a raving beast that’s quite free with vigorous expressions of his will that you do not take his food under pain of experiencing his elbows and teeth for yourself.</p>
