<p>Help plan the wedding, of course!</p><p>Wait a minute, has the panda proposed yet? Or is she going to be non-traditional and do the proposing herself? You might need to put your arm around the panda and let him know just what he’s missing by not asking your amazing girlfriend to marry him.</p><p>You can use all your knowledge as the new bride’s best friend to plan the perfect proposal and wedding. You’ll do great, I have faith in you.</p>
