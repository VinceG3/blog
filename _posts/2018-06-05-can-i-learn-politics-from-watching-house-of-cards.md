<p>No, you can’t. You need a more in-depth examination of the subject before something like House of Cards will even start to make sense to you on more than a purely superficial level. It’s like expecting to learn how to develop applications by watching <i>The Social Network</i>.</p><p>That said, House of Cards is <b>way</b> better than The Social Network. Just not good enough to launch your political career with. Not even close.</p>
