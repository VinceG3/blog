title: Is it true that to be successful you have to work on things you don&#39;t like to do?

<p>Yes. This is categorical, you will not be able to find some end-run around it.</p><p>Why? Because success is defined by the fact that <b>other people are rewarding you for it</b>. It is up to society to determine what success is. Not you.</p><p>The reason why is simple if you think about it. In order to be successful, you must have what other people want. If other people want it then that thing must be scarce. For other people to give you that thing means you must give them something they value more highly.</p><p>Most of the time this is money. If you want me to give me money, then you have to give me something in return that I value more than money. Maybe it’s a really expertly cleaned carpet. (shoutout to <a href="/profile/Ross-Trittipo">Ross Trittipo</a>) Maybe it’s a new way of thinking about social media. Doesn’t matter what it is so long as I’m willing to pay you for it.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b50c43600d8f50e4ef7d99d61385ce55.webp"><p>Maybe it’s not money you’re after. Maybe it’s control over something, or prestige. Doesn’t matter, other people have to value what it is so much they’re willing to part with something they love in order to give it to you. If it were free then you wouldn’t call it success to get it.</p><p>Because other people are in charge of <b>what it means to be successful</b>, then what they want will never totally match up to what you yourself want to provide them. Ergo, you will always have to do something you don’t want in order to become successful.</p><p>The nice thing is, as you gain more power and resources, you also gain the ability to buy the services of other people to provide those things that you don’t want to provide. But if you never do them yourself, you’ll never be successful in the first place.</p><p>You have to decide on the broad strokes of what you want to become successful doing. Because you’ll be doing it for a long time.</p><p>Dwane Johnson, otherwise known as The Rock, became successful as a pro wrestler. He eventually got so successful as a pro wrestler that he thought he would try to make it as an actor, which is much nicer on the schedule and on the body than pro wrestling is.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5a586e40ae0a69b5f5a92f5ebb3a0e9f.webp"><p>It worked about as well as it could have, and The Rock found himself back in the ring again. If you could smell what The Rock was cooking, it would probably be another acting deal.</p><p>The reality is that there’s only so much room in Hollywood for big name actors. Johnson may have taken acting seriously. But obviously not seriously enough.</p><p>You’d think that Johnson’s first love was acting, but it wasn’t. Dwayne wanted to be a pro football player. But he wasn’t good enough for that. Now he’s too old to even try.</p><p>I wouldn’t shed too many tears for The Rock. Instead try to learn from him. Pick something you are good at and learn to love it. Dwayne Johnson never really loved pro wrestling. It’s a shame because he’s so good at it. He’s like Maximus in <i>Gladiator</i>, yelling at the crowd. “Is this what you want?” Sure, the crowd was happy with Maximus’s performance. But it’s Maximus that has to pay the price for his lack of inner peace.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9697a4c55394443d227a150f1648422e.webp">
