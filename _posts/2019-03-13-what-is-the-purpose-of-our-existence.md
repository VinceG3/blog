<p>It’s to find out what you love.</p><p>Allow me to point you to a previous answer: <a href="/Why-do-you-believe-evil-exists-and-where-did-it-come-from/answer/Vincent-Guidry-1">Vincent Guidry's answer to Why do you believe evil exists and where did it come from?</a></p><p>Now that you’ve read that answer, and gone over the broad strokes of Western religious moral tradition, and have been exposed to Swedenborg’s elegant framework for how all of existence operates, ask yourself a question: If not truth and love, then what?</p><p>What underlying principle girds the world and everything in it? Whatever you say can be seen as just a sub-part, or correspondence, of truth or/and love. What do you as a person seek out in life when you have nothing else to focus on? Whatever it is, that’s what you love.</p><p>Our brains are finely tuned for their discovery. All rationality seeks to understand and explain them. Love governs what individuals choose to do, truth governs how they go about it.</p><p>Discovery of love is the only thing that makes sense as an answer to the question, what is the purpose of life.</p>
