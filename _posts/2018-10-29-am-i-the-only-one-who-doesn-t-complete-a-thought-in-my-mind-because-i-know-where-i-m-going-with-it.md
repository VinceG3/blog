<p>The way thought works in the brain neurologically is that brain activity is you trying to figure something out. Once you’ve figured it out, the brain goes silent.</p><p>So your brain figuring it out and then not carrying out linguistic representation of the conclusion is just normal brain function. There’s nothing to be gained by having those thoughts so they go unexpressed.</p>
