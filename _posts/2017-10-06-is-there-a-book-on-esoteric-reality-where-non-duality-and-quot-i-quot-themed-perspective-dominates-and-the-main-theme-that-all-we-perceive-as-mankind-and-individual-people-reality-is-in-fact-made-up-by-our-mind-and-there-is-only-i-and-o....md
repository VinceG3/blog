title: Is there a book on esoteric reality where non-duality and &quot;I&quot; themed perspective dominates and the main theme that all we perceive as mankind and individual people reality is in fact made up by our mind, and there is only “I” and oneness?

<p>Dr. David R. Hawkins plays a trick with grammar in which he eschews personal pronouns throughout his books. It makes it hard to read at first, but once you get the logic of it down, it makes his points a lot easier to understand. Here’s just one sentence:</p><p>“The purpose of the work presented here is to share the subjective unfoldment of Inner Realization in such a manner that it potentiates the process in the student and provides the essential information that facilitates the major evolution of the Subjectivity of Reality to Awareness.”</p><p>He never refers to ‘I’, and instead refers to ‘consciousness’. The effect is to dissociate you from your identity. The previous excerpt was from <i>Discovery of the Presence of God: Devotional Nonduality</i>, and is available on Amazon and Kindle.</p><p>If you do pick it up, hit me up and we can do discussion sessions.</p>
