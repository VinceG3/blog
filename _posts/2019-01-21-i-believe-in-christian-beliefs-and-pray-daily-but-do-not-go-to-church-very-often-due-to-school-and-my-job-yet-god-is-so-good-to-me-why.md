title: I believe in Christian beliefs, and pray daily, but do not go to church very often due to school and my job, yet God is so good to me. Why?

<p>Nowhere in the Bible does it say you should be going to church. Churches weren’t around in Jesus’s day, there was only the Temple, and it was so full of evil that Jesus only went there once, to throw out all the moneylenders and tell them they were all going to hell.</p><p>You are doing exactly as Jesus wants. Praying is all that is required. Some churches have extremely caustic cultures. My mom is very devout but couldn’t find a church that agreed with her, and she tried really hard to find one.</p><p>People insist you go to church, but God will only nudge you to start going if it’s right for you.</p>
