<p>I believe it's possible, but it's so difficult that in practice there are only going to be a handful of people on the planet at any given time doing it.</p><p>There are rules of magic that you can't break. Those rules make magic impractical, but not impossible. If I had to boil down the restriction into a single sentence, it would be, you can't force your beliefs onto anyone.</p><p>Impracticality plus the need for belief make it all but out of reach.</p>
