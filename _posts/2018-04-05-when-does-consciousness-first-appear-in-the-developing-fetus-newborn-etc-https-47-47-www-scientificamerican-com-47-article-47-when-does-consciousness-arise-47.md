<p>Anencephaly is when the brain fails to develop due to a birth defect. They’re born without the forebrain, which is required for consciousness. As a result infants born this way never reach consciousness and die within hours or days after birth if they aren’t stillborn. Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube_defect" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></p><p>These structures start forming in the sixth week of conception. Neuronal activity might happen before then but it shouldn’t be considered to be conscious activity until these parts of the brain are there to organize and direct it. Just being responsive doesn’t mean you’re conscious.</p>
