<p>If she’s your mother. Not all mothers are capable of loving their offspring, but the ones that are will love you way way more than you could ever love them back.</p><p>My mother’s mother abandoned her as a child and still can’t have a proper relationship with her. I don’t ever want to test the limits of how much my mother loves me.</p><p>If she’s not your mom? Well, everybody’s got a certain capacity for love, and they generally look for someone who is worth it. Most of the time they’re not. I’ll leave it to you to decide whether you’re worth it or not.</p>
