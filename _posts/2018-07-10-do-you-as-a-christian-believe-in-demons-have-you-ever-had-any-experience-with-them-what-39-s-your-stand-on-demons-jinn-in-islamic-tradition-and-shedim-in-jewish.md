<p>I believe in demons, I do not have any direct experience with them, I believe that demons can only affect the comparatively weak-willed, and I'm anything but.</p><p>The spiritual realm operates according to the held beliefs of the people believing in it. A person can conjure up a demon if they're interested enough in it, just through belief. And a person interested enough in casting the demon out of that person can perform an exorcism.</p><p>What's not possible is forcing someone to believe in something. So unless a person believes in demons, a demon cannot infest them. Even if 'something' gets in there, the person won't perceive it as a demon attack, and so it will have a tough time really taking hold. Demons slowly override the will of the people they infest. They can only get so far unless the person has a deep inner belief in them.</p><p>Atheists, before you call me silly, think about the figurative sense entailed when you talk about someone dealing with their demons, say, like alcoholism. It's the same thing. The mind turning deep belief into reality and having that sap your willpower.</p>
