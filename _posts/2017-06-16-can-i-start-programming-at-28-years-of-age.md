<p>Sure!</p><p>You have one decision to make here. Are you trying to get a job, or are you just trying to have fun? If you’re trying to get a job then I strongly urge you to look into the services of a code camp. The learning curve to get up to speed enough to get a job is extremely steep, code camps give you just enough structure and direction and hand-holding to get up it.</p><p>But if you’re not trying to change careers, then programming for fun is a really great hobby. You can just pick areas of interest and dive into them. What I would do is to pick something accessible and just follow the example. Then tweak it a little bit. Take it slow and don’t try to bite off a whole lot at a single time.</p>
