<p>TL:DR get a medical degree.</p><p>You really canâ€™t. This stuff is super-tricky, you need a long time studying the clinical history of psychopathy to even understand what to look for. Then you have to get the person into a controlled setting and see how they respond to tests developed specifically to tease out personality traits. With psychopathy you can run a brain scan. Not possible with sociopathy.</p>
