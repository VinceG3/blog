<p>Personally, I like sleep deprivation as a last-ditch depression treatment. Something about just staying up as long as possible just exhausts your ability to feel terrible about yourself. You’re just too tired for that shit.</p><p>Eventually your mind ‘reboots’ and it’s kind of like dying and getting reborn. Highly recommended for heartbreak.</p><p>I’ve also done massive amounts of cardio, that works decently too, also helps with your waistline.</p>
