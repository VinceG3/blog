<p>The journey to enlightenment begins and ends with surrender. In the beginning, small things are surrendered, like an hour or two here and there to reading and studying. Soon, many hours of meditation are given. Eventually one starts to surrender their beliefs and understandings. Then they start to surrender their desires and egocentrisms. In the end, a final surrender is made, of all of self.</p><p>The small concessions are needed to build up momentum so that one can surrender more and more deeply. This is not a small task, itâ€™s not in the ballpark of building a new closet. This is the ultimate life-changing surgery, and you have to do it yourself on yourself. So learn how to sew at least before you chop yourself open and rearrange everything.</p>
