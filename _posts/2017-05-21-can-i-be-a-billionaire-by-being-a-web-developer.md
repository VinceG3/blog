<p>No, you have to be a businessman too. You just can’t sell web development all by itself and make a billion dollars for it. Even if you had that many customers, you personally couldn’t actually produce that much product.</p><p>The only way to get there is to start a web development business. But while a web development business could easily make you a millionaire, it’s a hard sell to push enough product to make you a billionaire.</p><p>To become a billionaire, you need to act on the scale of an entire <i>industry</i>, not just a business. The only reliable way to do that is with political assistance. Political backscratching is about as far from web development as you can get.</p>
