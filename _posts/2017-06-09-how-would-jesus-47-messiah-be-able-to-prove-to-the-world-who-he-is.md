<p>A2A, hell if I know. Proof implies some kind of logic regime in which one can decide whether the claim is true or false. The world would have to change such that you could verify it one way or another.</p><p>It’s kind of like asking what ways a knight would move in tic-tac-toe. You’d have to change the game to accommodate knights first. Well here, God would have to change the world to such that a new Jesus could prove himself.</p><p>Otherwise you’re stuck with the mechanics of myth. But here’s the kicker, unless He actually perpetuated the system whereby Jesus could prove himself into perpetuity, eventually Jesus would devolve into a mythical tale anyway. So what does it really matter whether he can prove himself now or not?</p>
