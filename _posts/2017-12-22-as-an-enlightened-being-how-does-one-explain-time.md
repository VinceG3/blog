title: As an enlightened being, how does one explain time?

<p>As an illusion just like everything else.</p><p>Time is created by the mind. Sure, there’s some bit of it that’s created by the world around us, but our <i>experience</i> of time is created by our minds. This can be manipulated with mind games like anything else. For example, I can make a 4 hour car trip seem like 2 hours through trance work. My next trick will be to try to make it seem like 8 hours.</p>
