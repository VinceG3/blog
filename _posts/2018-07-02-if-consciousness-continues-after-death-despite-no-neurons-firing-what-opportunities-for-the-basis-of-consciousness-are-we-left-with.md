title: If consciousness continues after death despite no neurons firing, what opportunities for the basis of consciousness are we left with?

<p>The way I look at it is that we have an energy body that develops in concurrence with our physical body that we can detach in various ways while we’re alive, most notably for out of body experiences or near-death experiences, that separates fully once we “give up the ghost.” We can get pulled back in if for some reason our bodies and brains come back to life, but for the most part we’re free unless that happens.</p><p>The material world plays by its rules, and the spirit world has its own rules. Like here, our existence is dominated by what we believe in, only far, far more so in the spirit world. Our minds can affect the ether directly, in a way that’s impossible here. But our minds are reflections of our brains, and our minds are abstract in nature, not physical. It’s no big trick to separate it from the body.</p>
