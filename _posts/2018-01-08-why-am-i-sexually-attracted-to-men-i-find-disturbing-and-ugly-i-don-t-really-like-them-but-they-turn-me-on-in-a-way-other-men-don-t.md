<p>When your subconscious mind feels limited or constricted somehow, erotic thought generation is one of the ways it seeks out a blue ocean to roam free in. Essentially, you have two ‘brains’ rumbling around in there, the one that wants to keep everything buttoned up and reasonable and presentable to the world, and the one that wants release from all that.</p><p>My usual answer to this kind of question applies, explore erotic literature. When I was younger, I just wanted big boobs and big butts, because that’s all the erotic material I had access to was visual pornography. Erotic literature paints vivid scenarios where you can actually imagine yourself in various situations. It’s a powerful tool for self-discovery, allowing you to explore fetishes and curiosities without having to actually involve other people, with the attendant risks of pregnancy, STI, or an abusive partner.</p><p>You want to laser in on the particular elements that you find exciting, not try to force yourself to enjoy stories that you would want yourself to.</p>
