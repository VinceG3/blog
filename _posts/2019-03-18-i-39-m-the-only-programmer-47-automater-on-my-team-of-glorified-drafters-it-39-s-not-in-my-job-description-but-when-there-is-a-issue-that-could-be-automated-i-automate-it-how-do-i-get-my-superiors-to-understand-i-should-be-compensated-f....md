title: I&#39;m the only programmer&#47;automater on my team of glorified drafters.It&#39;s not in my job description, but when there is a issue that could be automated, I automate it. How do I get my superiors to understand I should be compensated for this extra work?

<p>Document, document, document. Everything you automate, take care to note two things. How much time it takes to do it, and how often it's getting done. Make a guess as to how much money you're saving the company in salary. Put this information in two places. On your formal, written request for a raise, and your resume.</p>
