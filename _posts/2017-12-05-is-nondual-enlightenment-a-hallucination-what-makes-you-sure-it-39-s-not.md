<p>Enlightenment, as the Buddhists put it, is something you achieve after a lot of meditative practice. In the process of achieving it, you encounter a great great deal of actual hallucinations. You meditate on those hallucinations and discover what’s real and what’s not. (protip: none of it is real)</p><p>By the time you reach enlightenment you’re so familiar with how hallucination presents itself that you’re well-able to see that nonduality is characterized by the lack of hallucination, not the presence of it.</p>
