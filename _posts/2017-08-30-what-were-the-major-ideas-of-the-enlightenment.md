<p>Non-dual mode of thought: Stimulis don’t provoke programmed patterns of thought, thought runs in random directions with every stimulus.</p><p>Blessed: One is untouched by negative events in life, such things are transformed to positive ones.</p><p>Growth cessation: No more spiritual growth can be found in Earthly / human life so you will no longer incarnate on Earth or as a human.</p><p>Cultural: enlightenment only exists for a short period of time in which the conditions were ripe for a certain kind of human experience. Like 90s music. We could make nineties-style music today, but it just won’t be the same.</p><p>Celebrity: You’re enlightened by virtue of how many people you help in life.</p><p>Historical: The Enlightenment was a period of history in which the scientific revolution flowered along with the Renaissance to produce a new body of philosophical and political work pulling away from the influence of religion.</p><p>Zen: enlightenment refers to a specific kind of epiphany that happens to you and then passes. Constant effort is required to string these experiences together.</p><p>Hawkins: Human consciousness exists on a scale from 1 to 1000. Enlightenment happens when your consciousness reaches level 600.</p>
