<p>What do you want to do? Just go do that because any real course of action to rectify the moral and ethical problems you have with your behavior is going to run smack into the personal problem that drive you into the situation in the first place.</p><p>I'm sorry you're having to deal with being stuck between a rock and a hard place, but that's what ignoring morals and ethics in favor of personal fulfillment does to you eventually.</p><p>Either he's going to find out or he isn't. You need to plan for both eventualities. Know what you're going to do if you suddenly get separated from your husband. Your affair is going to end one way or another. It would be nice to have some say in how.</p><p>If you think far enough ahead, you can get through it without too much disruption. The worst is when you get caught in a situation you didn't plan for. So make a list of possible outcomes and know how you're going to respond.</p><p>Now is not the time to suddenly develop a conscience. Guilt will only tear your family apart even worse than it already has been. You don't have that luxury anymore. For your family's sake, be pragmatic.</p>
