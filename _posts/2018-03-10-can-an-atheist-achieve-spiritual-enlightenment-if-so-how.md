<p>If you do not believe in spirituality, then you cannot be spiritually enlightened. Kinda goes with the territory.</p><p>Atheism cannot survive sincere mysticism. The experiences one has when diving into the self invariably dispel the illusion of materialism.</p><p>It is true, not all atheists are materialists, but the philosophy of materialism is intrinsic to most who hold the position.</p><p>Without materialism, the only thing left to atheism the the lack of belief in a God. Again, sincere mysticism dispels that too. You're knocking on the door of God, when He finally answers, that's the end of your atheism, you're never getting that back, sorry.</p><p>Discovery of God is just <b>one</b> step in the path to enlightenment. There are many many more on the journey.</p><p>Spiritual enlightenment resolves the dilemma between faith and reason. The rationalist position as the two being incompatible is simply absurd.</p><p>That said, God does not have to totally dominate one's life. The role God takes on varies throughout life. Enlightenment is mastery of the path. Therefore in a way you've mastered God.</p>
