<p>A2A, sounds like some event in your past that you likely forgot all about struck you deeply and set up an irrational trigger in your psyche. It could have been as simple and silly as seeing one of your neighbors acting stupid under the influence. This sort of thing can mix weirdly with underlying psychology and produce impossible-to-grok effects.</p><p>When I was a kid I used to watch a buddy of mine act irrationally around this girl he liked. This interacted with the fact that past family life and messed with my ability to have ‘normal’ relationships. Really it was the stuff buried deep down rather than my buddy’s experience, but that formative experience in my preteen years brought it to the surface.</p><p>I don’t know any way to just ‘fix’ it, moving forward to me seems to be somewhat akin to trauma alleviation. You trigger the behavior in ‘safe’ contexts, and keep triggering it until it doesn’t cause the behavior any more.</p><p>So you might try going to bars as a therapeutic practice.</p><p>Actually digging into your past to try to find whatever it is that caused it is likely going to be unhelpful.</p>
