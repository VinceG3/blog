<p>Learn how to code and do it yourselves. Starting a company is a decade-long adventure if you're successful, though timeframes <b>can</b> be significantly shorter if you're unbelievably lucky, it's not something to rely on.</p><p>In the long run, learning how to code and making the app yourself doesn't take that much time and significantly improves your chance for success.</p><p>If you’re too old and too rich for that shit, then look into the services of a consulting company like the one that I work for. We’ll be happy to take your money and make your app for you. It’s what we do.</p>
