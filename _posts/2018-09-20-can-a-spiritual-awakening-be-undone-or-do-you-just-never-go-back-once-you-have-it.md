<p>Spirituality changes who you are. Full stop.</p><p>You don’t want a spirituality that doesn’t have the potential to do that. In fact, we have a name for it, <i>entertainment</i>.</p><p>Spirituality is scary and sacred and you should bring your absolute best to it so it can take that best and make it even better.</p><p>Sit on your butt and re-watch Game of Thrones for the fifteenth time and dream of being Daenerys, or go out and get a Norse ritual kit and perform a ritual to Odin asking him for vengeance on that bitch Stacy for stealing your thunder at the meeting yesterday.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-526ea0f01f26cd80b8b6c4c055794c78"><p><i>Just before pouring the congealed blood of your enemies into the bowl</i></p><p>Then when you see that ratchet ho spill her coffee everywhere in the middle of the next meeting, you’ll finally understand the power you’re invoking and life won’t be the same again. You’ll be hooked on the power and responsibility. Why would you ever want to go back to the boring life before you had all those mad skillz?</p>
