title: Why do men say and act like they care about me but won&#39;t text me for more than ten minutes?

<p>Men have what I like to call “foraging behavior.” They want something very badly for like 10 minutes. If you’re a female, and a guy is talking to you, there’s a really good chance he’s ‘foraging’ for an easy way to smash with you. If he can’t get it, he’ll go ‘forage’ somewhere else.</p><p>It seems to be built into the masculine nature. Men always have something that’s eating up their time and attention. To grow as a man is to master this aspect of themselves. To grow as a woman inevitably means to master this aspect of men.</p><p>I don’t know why this is, it’s not like women never ‘forage’, or that guys couldn’t profit from being able to think around that behavior, life just seems to be set up this way. I think foraging just makes up more of a man’s experience than it does for women, and so women have to deal with it mostly through men.</p>
