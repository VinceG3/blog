<p>You can’t. And she has 18 years in which to decide that having kids is hard and she wants some financial help. And it won’t be hard for her to realize that she can force you to provide it.</p><p>Tell her to look into the services of a sperm bank.</p><p>Of all the stupid things guys can do, this has to qualify as one of the dumbest. There’s literally no upside for you, nothing but downside.</p>
