<p>Umm, Ruby programming?</p><p>Ruby jobs are clustered in geographic areas. It’s possible to get remote jobs, but you’re competing with guys in Eastern Europe who are willing to take $10 an hour. And if they’re paying top coin then you’ll be competing with ninjas who are taking a pay cut from $200k+ because they want to live out in the country. So if you can’t find a job where you’re at, get in a car and drive to the nearest city with a Ruby Meetup group.</p><p>At my group, before the speakers give their presos, they spend a full 15 minutes going around the room. Anyone with a job they need filled can announce who they are and what they’re looking for, then anyone who needs a job can introduce themselves.</p><p>So you don’t have to bother lining up interviews or whatever before getting in the car. You can just go to the meetup, and make some good connections. Before you know it you’ll be interviewing!</p>
