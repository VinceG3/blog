title: If a Christian accepts evolution, must they dismiss the Eden account as allegory? If so, are they not then dismissing the concept of &quot;original sin&quot;? Doesn&#39;t that make Jesus&#39; sacrifice moot?

<p>Calling something allegory isn’t dismissing it. Things have allegorical truth whether or not they have historical truth.</p><p>The story of Adam and Eve is a trenchant observation on the nature of humanity. Given complete paradise, direct access to God, and all we could ever need, humans manage to screw it up anyway. The allegorical content is <i>more important</i> than the historical implications.</p><p>This is true of most scripture, by the way. They’re folk tales originally passed around simply because people enjoyed hearing and thinking about them. The religion that cropped up around it came later.</p><p>Think about it this way. If you were God, and you held truth that humanity couldn’t even fathom, wouldn’t you want to give them at least <i>something</i> to go on? That’s what scripture is. Stories good enough to base a religion on. But not perfect representations of reality.</p>
