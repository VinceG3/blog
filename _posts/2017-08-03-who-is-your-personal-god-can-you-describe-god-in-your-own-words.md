<p>Interesting question to try to answer, thanks Hillary!</p><p>I think of different ‘tiers’ of God. God’s not just one thing. At the top level, God is the <i>source of all things</i>. He’s the very stuff we, and the rest of the universe, is made of.</p><p>This aspect of God interweaves with the next level of God, which is the <i>personalized aspect</i>. This is what most people think of when they think of God. I think of this God as being <i>composed</i> of countless souls that have all decided to become a part of him. I’d go more into detail, but it’s really beyond the scope of the answer. Suffice it to say that this God is more like a corporation than a person.</p><p>Finally, there’s the <i>individual aspect</i>. Every person’s subconscious connects and intertwines with the higher levels, this is how prayer works. If ever you hear back from God, it’s the individual aspect you’re hearing.</p>
