<p>This is the process of insight. When you see into things, you see what makes up those things. If you disassemble a shirt into component parts, the shirt no longer looks or feels or seems like a shirt, even though all the parts are there. The shirt seems unreal.</p><p>Same way with reality. Deconstructing it into component parts causes reality to lose its structure. Then it seems as an illusion.</p><p>When you’ve deconstructed the self in this same way, you have what’s called a <i>satori</i> experience. Do this enough times in enough ways, and we call that enlightenment.</p>
