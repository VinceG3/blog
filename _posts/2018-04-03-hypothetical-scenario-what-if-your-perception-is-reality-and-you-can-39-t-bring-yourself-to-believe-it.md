title: Hypothetical scenario: what if your perception is reality and you can&#39;t bring yourself to believe it?

<p>Perception cannot be reality. Not in any conception of reality can perception ever completely match reality. This illusion suffices to prove my point:</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6ae558b75ac8f30b851515e6d07d5fb2-c"><p>Your brain filters out the dots until you’re actually looking at them. Your beliefs order your reality, at both the sensual level and the cognitive one. You could not operate as a sentient being otherwise.</p><p>There is only one exception to this rule. If you’re God.</p><p>So, if you load up a game of Minecraft in Creative, you’re essentially God of that realm. You are infinitely powerful, you can even start and stop time by pausing the game. Your perception about the game is limited only by your willingness to gather it.</p><p>This strikes me as being a quite similar state of affairs to how God engages with us. God wants us to be moral and just, and instead humans are wicked and cruel.</p><p>So basically, your hypothetical situation is that you’re God. God knows everything about everyone, and has infinite power to change those things, yet instead he forms beliefs about the beings populating his realm and asks us to change to fit those beliefs.</p>
