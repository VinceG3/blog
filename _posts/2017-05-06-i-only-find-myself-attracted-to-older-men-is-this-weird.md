<p>Hehe, 25 year olds are by no means “older men.” They’re just kids with a little life experience. I’m 33 and I’m only just now barely considering myself an adult.</p><p>Either way, I don’t blame you. Don’t apologize for your feelings. They’re amongst the very few things that we have that are really ours.</p>
