<p>Buddhism is a <b>religion</b>, meaning that it’s a shared set of spiritual beliefs. I have no idea where this particular notion of yours came from, but literally millions of people are Buddhists, so you’re going to be able to find at least one affirmed Buddhist that holds the particular beliefs you’re asking about, potentially lots of them.</p><p>Does that mean that this is “according to Buddhism?” Of course not.</p>
