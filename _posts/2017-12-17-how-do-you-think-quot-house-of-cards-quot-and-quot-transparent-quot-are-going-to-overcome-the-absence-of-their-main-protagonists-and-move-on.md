<p>I haven’t watched Transparent, but you are mistaken in thinking that House of Cards is going to “overcome and move on.” It’s getting a short final season to wrap up and that’ll be all she wrote. Nobody on the show is going to be giving it their full effort and watching it is going to feel like being on a sinking ship.</p>
