<p>The problem is how you’re using words.</p><p>If God wills something to happen, it happens. If God wishes for something to happen, then it might or might not happen. Same as any of us, the only difference is that God could choose to make his wish his will or his will his wish, whereas for us, what we can’t will, we wish.</p><p>Anybody with children knows the difference. You make your children do things, then hope they later learn to do them on their own. You can keep making them do it, but that’s not really the point.</p>
