<p>I think from an evolutionary perspective, we’re all essentially crippled. Our muscles are soft, our lungs can’t move air, we can’t hunt for shit. When we start exercising, if we’re not super-careful, we can easily injure the shit out of ourselves.</p><p>Even the strongest bodybuilder or the most athletic football player is basically a one-trick pony. How the hell does he expect to fight off a tiger wanting his food?</p>
