<p>As a rule, I don’t allow myself to get annoyed or frustrated at another person’s views. Whatever another person thinks is their own business. If I can’t even take your views seriously, then they’re not even worth thinking about, much less getting emotional over.</p><p>If I wanted to discuss it with her then I’d first ask myself what I’m hoping to accomplish. In your case I’d be interested in seeing her justify a blatantly unequal point of view. It would be up to her to convince me to take her seriously. If she can’t then she just goes back into the “people to ignore” pile.</p><p>How another person thinks has absolutely zero bearing on me unless I choose to let it.</p><p>I get annoyed at someone if they don’t give me the choice to ignore them. A good example is when people act like idiots on the road. If you make me deal with you being a jackass, I will get annoyed at you, and I’ll retaliate if I can find an appropriate way to do so. For example if they change lanes in front of me without signaling, I might return the favor if I get the chance to. Either way I forget about it pretty quickly and go about my day. Life’s too short to take this kind of crap with you.</p><p>Merely saying stupid shit on the Internet doesn’t affect me at all.</p>
