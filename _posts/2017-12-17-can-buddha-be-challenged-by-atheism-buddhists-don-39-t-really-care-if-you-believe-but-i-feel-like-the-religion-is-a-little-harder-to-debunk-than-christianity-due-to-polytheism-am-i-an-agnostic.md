title: Can Buddha be challenged by atheism? Buddhists don&#39;t really care if you believe, but I feel like the religion is a little harder to debunk than Christianity, due to polytheism. Am I (an agnostic)?

<p>Buddhism is a religion with hundreds of millions of adherents. It has dogmas just like all the other religions. A materialistically-minded atheist is going to have a lot of trouble with anything other than the most sanitized version of Buddhism.</p><p>If you’re from the West, my advice to you is to find a Western spiritual tradition to get involved in. There’s lots of them to choose from. You will be happier and make more friends. When I was in my early twenties, I used to participate in a neopagan discussion group, this led to me joining a Wiccan coven for perhaps a year. Even smaller cities can usually support at least one such discussion group, that group becomes an important hub for people to connect through.</p><p>I don’t recommend Buddhism unless you have a passion or aptitude for meditation. Even if you do, I would still recommend exploring one of the traditions that involve it. As big as Buddhism is in the East, it’s still practically nonexistent here except for books of widely varying quality. The number one religion in the West worships $$$.</p>
