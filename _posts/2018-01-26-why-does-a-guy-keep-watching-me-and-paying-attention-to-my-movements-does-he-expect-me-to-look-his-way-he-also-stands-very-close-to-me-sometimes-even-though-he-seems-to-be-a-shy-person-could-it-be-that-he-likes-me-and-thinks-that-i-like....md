title: Why does a guy keep watching me and paying attention to my movements? Does he expect me to look his way? He also stands very close to me sometimes even though he seems to be a shy person? Could it be that he likes me and thinks that I like him?

<p>If I’m watching/staring at a girl it means that I find her incomparably beautiful, looking at her brings far more delight than anything else I could be doing at the time. I personally try to limit the staring because I don’t like making people uncomfortable, particularly girls I’m interested in. But a lot of guys won’t have that kind of self-control.</p>
