title: My employer asked me what I think are some good personal goals for this year. I already have a degree, I&#39;m single and I have just a normal position (non-management) at my work. How should I answer this question? Any ideas?

<p>Answer it honestly. What do you want?</p><p>I have to say, as someone who is at the moment professionally unfulfilled, it would be nice to have someone at my job who both a) cares about my goals, and b) is in a real position to help me achieve them.</p><p>Do you want a career change? Does that change involve moving into management? Do you want to stay where you are and work on personal things? Whatever your wishes are, your boss can help transform them into actionable goals, and plans for achieving them.</p><p>You can talk the wishes over and come to an understanding of what’s needed to get you there and whether the company can help you.</p><p>Realize that advancement in most companies means moving into management. Your boss can help you with this. You can lead a team, then a department. It’s more fun, less demanding, and pays more. Downside is you’re more accountable.</p><p>If that’s what you want, you need to be working with your employer to get there. You’ll get feedback that you need to listen to and incorporate. Your ability to incorporate the feedback will directly affect your rise.</p>
