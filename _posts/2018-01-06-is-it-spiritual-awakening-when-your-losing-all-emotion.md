title: Is it spiritual awakening when your losing all emotion?

<p>No, losing all your emotions is called <i>anhedonia</i> and even that isn’t the loss of all emotion, just the loss of one particular range of emotion. There is no definable concept that I can point to to refer to people that have lost all emotion.</p><p>I am both enlightened, and awakened. I was enlightened since birth, and I would put my spiritual awakening at the event in my mid-twenties when I suddenly started talking directly to my Higher Self. My emotional development was psychopathic until my early twenties when I somehow decided I wanted to be an emotional person and so somehow devised my own approach for moving away from psychopathy.</p><p>My emotional development is ongoing. I would never believe anyone who says they’re enlightened who also claims they don’t have any emotions. I’d say they just believe they’re enlightened based on some stuff they heard. They have emotions but they don’t understand them. Therefore they have a low emotional intelligence.</p><p>You can still be enlightened and have a low emotional quotient. But you can’t say you’re enlightened <i>because</i> you have a low emotional quotient. The difference is subtle but profound.</p>
