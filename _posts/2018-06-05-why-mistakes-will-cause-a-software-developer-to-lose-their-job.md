title: Why mistakes will cause a software developer to lose their job?

<p>This really depends on the job. In theory, once somebody has a professional job, only egregious personal conduct unbecoming of the profession or changes in the underlying business making him redundant or unneeded should cause them to lose their jobs. But the landing should be relatively soft, 3 months full severance pay is standard.</p><p>In practice, developers can be thrown under the bus just like everyone else as scapegoats for company problems. You see this happening more in shops that donâ€™t primarily hire developers.</p>
