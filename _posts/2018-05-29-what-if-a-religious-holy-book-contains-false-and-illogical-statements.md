<p>The whole purpose of spirituality is to bring you closer to the irrational and transcendent, so finding illogic in the Bible is just scripture doing what it does. If it wasn’t mysterious, it wouldn’t be worth bothering with.</p><p>I’ve read lots of spiritual books that are really hard to read, contains downright false and misleading statements, and which weren’t terribly rational. I warmed to the challenge and pushed through anyway. Totally worth it, great training for how the human mind works.</p>
