title: What is the difference between hope and faith?

<p>Faith is knowing things are going to happen a certain way, hope is wishing they will. I have faith that God works the way I think He works and that life isn’t going to suddenly turn the tables on me for no reason. I <i>hope</i> that I can accomplish my goals the way that I want to accomplish them, but I have faith that if I can’t, then it’s probably for the best.</p>
