<p>There’s conflicting narratives to parse through here. There’s the historical time period in which we know a lot of from the writings of historians, and there’s the mythical narrative where things happen at the rhythm and pace and rhyme and tenor of storytelling.</p><p>So if you’re dealing with the mythical Jesus, as told in the Bible, then you need to deal with the logic of myth.</p><p>If you want fact, then you need to deal with the real Rome.</p><p>And Rome didn’t execute people for talking. They executed people for organizing against Rome, or just thinking about conspiring against Rome. If they executed Jesus, chances are that’s why.</p><p>Here’s an interesting article on the subject: <a href="http://jesushistoryproject.com/execution/" data-qt-tooltip="jesushistoryproject.com">Why did the Romans execute Jesus?</a></p><p>If you want an “in-universe” answer, the biblical narrative portrays Pilate as wanting not to execute Jesus, and Jesus as practically asking for crucifixion, begging even. He knew God’s plan was for him to die on the cross, and he went willingly to it. Pilate didn’t really have a choice.</p>
