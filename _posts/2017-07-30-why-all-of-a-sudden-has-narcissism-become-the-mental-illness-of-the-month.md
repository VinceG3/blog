<p>I've been noticing questions about narcissism since I started participating on Quora. I notice no more and no less attention on it than normal. Perhaps you upvoted a few answers so Quora thinks you're interested in it.</p><p>Narcissism is one of those things that takes people by surprise. You think you understand people, then you run into someone that completely annihilates your sense of control over your relationship.</p>
