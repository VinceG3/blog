<p>My favorite thing about Buddhism is how it’s bringing religion, spirituality and mysticism to a generation of Westerners. It’s really quite remarkable. People who claim themselves to be total rational materialists fool themselves into believing metaphysical truths, like the nonexistence of self. They’ll sit in prayer, oh I mean meditation, and form deep communion with God, oh I mean the spaces in between self. Even going so far as reading scripture, wait I meant dharma.</p><p>Truly fascinating.</p>
