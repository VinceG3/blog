<p>He did! The Garden of Eden was paradise on Earth. All trees bore succulent and delicious fruit. All animals were peaceful. All we had to do was to follow Godâ€™s commandment to not eat from the tree of knowledge and we could have lived there forever.</p><p>There was no morals, nothing to do but to live pleasantly and peacefully.</p><p>But man chose knowledge over comfort. God saw that his garden was too good for us so He cast us out into the world to make our own paradise. Instead we make our own hell.</p><p>This is allegory for the truth that if you have no wants, then you have no drive to learn and grow.</p>
