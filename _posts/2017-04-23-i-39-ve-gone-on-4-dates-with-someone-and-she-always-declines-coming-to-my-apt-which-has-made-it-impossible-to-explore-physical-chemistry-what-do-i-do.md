<p>Your dating life is going to get a lot simpler once you realize that not everybody that <i>wants</i> to date actually has <i>time</i> to date. These days, if I have any issues at all coordinating for a date, I just stop trying and let it go.</p><p>If I had a few dates with a lady and she cut it off just when it was starting to get interesting, I’d say something like, “you’re a great lady and I like spending time with you, but this isn’t really working for me. I hope when you can free up some time for dating, that I’m the first guy you call.” Then give her a hug and take my leave. Keep up with her on Facebook once a month or so.</p>
