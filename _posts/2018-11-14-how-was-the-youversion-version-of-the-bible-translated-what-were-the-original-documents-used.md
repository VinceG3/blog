<p>YouVersion did not translate the Bible. Instead they compiled other translations of the Bible to include in their app. Each individual version has its own attribution and source documents. You can change translations while reading by tapping the menu bar the translation shorthand button, I think it defaults to the New International Version, NIV. This will bring down the list of available translations. You can download your favorite translations on this selection page as well. This way you donâ€™t need an available internet connection to read.</p>
