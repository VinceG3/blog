title: Why did my twin flame tell me he doesn&#39;t love me anymore when his friends are telling me he does? I blocked him on social media after he broke up with me and it&#39;s been 4 months but I can still feel the connection.

<p>My suggestion is to forget about all this twin flame nonsense. All it’s doing is setting unrealistic expectations about what your relationships are going to look like.</p><p>You want to get back together with a guy who broke up with you. Your friends are telling you he’s still into you but he himself doesn’t seem interested in a relationship with you.</p><p>You’re not asking for advice, you want to understand the situation. But as far as I can tell, there’s nothing new to find out. You have all the information you need.</p><p>My best guess here is that you’re hoping this twin flame nonsense will cause him to magically want to jump back into your arms. Instead of, ya know, just approaching him and asking him if he’s interested. Maybe you already did that and he said no. In which case there’s nothing to do but to move on.</p>
