<p>You would have to take them to court for copyright infringement. Unless you have a very good reason why your contract arrangement was not be a work-for-hire one and/or very good legal representation, expect the judge to quickly rule that it was work-for-hire and the copyright belongs to the company who paid you to make it.</p><p>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and this answer does not constitute legal advice.</p>
