title: Why can&#39;t I explain to theists that God does not exist?

<p>Because they’re not really interested in hearing your arguments. I personally restrict my discussion on this topic to answering Quora questions, because while I don’t remember a whole lot about how I thought or why when I was an atheist 12 years ago, I remember enough to know just how annoying it was to get grilled just for expressing my feelings.</p><p>This particular theist would love to hear your arguments. I can even try to pretend like they have a snowball’s chance in Hell of convincing me for you if you like. I’ve been having these arguments for 15 years, yet the subject still seems as relevant as it ever was.</p><p>But you better be prepared for my counterpoints.</p>
