title: Is the future secure for a software engineer?

<p>I believe what learning software engineering does for you is safeguard a relatively comfortable lifestyle for yourself. I do not believe that software engineers are threatened like, say, truck drivers are. Much is made of artificial intelligence, but there is always going to be a large gap in what markets want and what artificial intelligence can automate.</p><p>Eventually machine learning will be an essential part of every software project. The machine learning will do what it does best, data analysis, and engineers will do the rest. Data analysis has always been a really hard problem and few companies ever looked deeply into their own data.</p><p>That said, I would greatly welcome a world in which my skills are obsolete. Iâ€™d give my left arm and right testicle to live in that world. That would be <b>awesome</b>.</p>
