title: How long will it take for my BF to commit and change his approach into getting married? We dated for 2 years then broke up as relationship was too much for him and got back after 8 months. All is well but he says he won’t marry me or any other girl.

<p>You’re lucky in that he’s verbally <b>telling</b> you his stance on commitment. Many many many many guys simply won’t open up about that, or worse, lie.</p><p>But being willing to be honest with that information does no good whatsoever, not to him, not to you, not to the relationship, if you refuse to acknowledge it, or worse, refuse to admit that he actually has a choice in the matter.</p><p>You say all is well, but the only reason it’s well is because you’re believing in a lie. If you were to stop doing that, then you will realize that you’re building your life on top of that lie. And it’s not a lie that he’s tried to push off on you to keep you around, it’s a lie <b>that you’re telling yourself</b> in order to keep him around.</p>
