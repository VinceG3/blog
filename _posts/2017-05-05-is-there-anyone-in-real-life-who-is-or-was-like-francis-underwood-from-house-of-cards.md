<p>A2A, if anyone in my life resembles Francis it’s me. I have a very loose, Darwinian sense of morality, think my love life will have to resemble his, with an anchor wife and many short-term lovers, and am always cognizant of the intricacies of the power dynamics of any situation.</p><p>Where we differ is that I don’t see power as something to strive for in and of itself. Francis is practically superhuman, he’s skilled both at being a power behind the throne and being on the throne himself. I think I’d make a decent king, but I simply don’t have the drive it takes to reach for the brass ring.</p>
