<p>Did the other answerer just look up the French for ‘crazy’?</p><p>Cajuns use the word ‘couyon’ as both an adjective and a noun. (the noun refers to “someone who is crazy”) It’s one of the words that has crossed over into English so you’ll see it interspersed in normal speak as well as in French conversations.</p>
