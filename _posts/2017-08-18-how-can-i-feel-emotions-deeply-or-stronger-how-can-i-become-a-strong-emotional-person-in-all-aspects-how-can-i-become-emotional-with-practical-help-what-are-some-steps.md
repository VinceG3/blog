<p>When I was in my early twenties, I did two things that I think really helped out with this. I watched a lot of anime, and I also learned to play piano. Anime had all these really deep and emotional storylines and it made me think about a lot of things I wasn’t used to thinking about. They also had these really neat soundtracks that I’d really get into. When I was listening to the soundtracks it made me think a lot about the storylines.</p><p>I’d then go get the sheet music for them and learn how to play some of them. My favorite was a composer who did a bunch of RPG games. Yasunori Mitsuda. Music seems to be a real gateway to emotional health I think. Especially playing it. You want your music to be evocative, and when you get into a good flow it’s really cathartic.</p>
