<p>If you can afford it, attend a bootcamp.</p><p>Doing it by yourself means that every single problem you have, no matter how big or how small, will entail a great deal of Googling and hunting and inference. If you have easy access to professionals who are paid to be there, then they can fix whatever you’re doing wrong and tell you why it’s wrong.</p><p>Handholding during the learning process is worth its weight in gold. Because it saves you something that’s worth more than gold: time.</p><p>I learned by myself. It was years and years before I felt confident enough to search for a job.</p>
