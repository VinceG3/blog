title: What is the easiest way to use the Law of Attraction?

<p>Build a system. I used to keep a journal of stuff I wanted to manifest. I’d spend some time every day meditating on the things I wanted to manifest and I’d cross them off the list once they did. Worked pretty well. During the meditation my subconscious would give me clues on what I could do to make them more likely to come about.</p><p>I stopped once I realized that all I was doing was keeping a journal, the universe provides whether I spent time forming the intention or not. Plus there’s lots of things the universe could give me that it couldn’t if I was super-focused on a particular path.</p><p>At the time I was doing it, “six figure job” wasn’t high up on my list of priorities. “Making the rent for the month” was. If you don’t make room in your life for the truly-amazing, then it really will have to be a miracle for it to happen to you.</p><p>So build your system, verify that it works and that the universe is awesome and the Law of Attraction works, then throw it away and live your life anew without fear or worry. Because if you keep “using” the Law of Attraction, then the Law of Attraction is just going to “use” you back.</p>
