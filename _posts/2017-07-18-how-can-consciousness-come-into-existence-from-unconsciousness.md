<p>Same way everything else arises, through the process we call evolution.</p><p>There are aspects of consciousness that pose interesting philosophical questions, but one thing we know about it is that we can stop it by obliterating the brain of the conscious person. This means consciousness is primarily a physical process. You can change the functioning of someoneâ€™s mind by doing things to the brain.</p><p>Furthermore, we can observe the behavior of animals and figure out some things about them. As a general rule, the more complex their brains and nervous systems are, the more complex their behavior. There is no hard line dividing conscious beings from non-conscious beings. It just gradually emerged over time.</p>
