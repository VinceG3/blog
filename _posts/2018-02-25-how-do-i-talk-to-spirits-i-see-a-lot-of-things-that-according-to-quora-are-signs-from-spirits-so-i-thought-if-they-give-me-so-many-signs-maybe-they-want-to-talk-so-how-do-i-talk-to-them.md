title: How do I talk to spirits? I see a lot of things that, according to Quora, are signs from spirits, so I thought if they give me so many signs maybe they want to talk. So how do I talk to them?

<p>You need to start to think of your whole body/mind as a conduit for communication. The word for this is “attuning.” Picture your whole body as a “antenna.” Close your eyes and ask a question to your mind. Then sit and ‘listen.’ Take any sensation you start to feel, as communication from the entity. Maybe some of it will be relevant, maybe it won’t. Just keep bouncing around feelings between you and the entity until you have something that’s kinda like a conversation. You can work on that until it’s an actual conversation.</p><p>This is where spiritual practices like chakra opening start to pay off. I’m not the biggest believer in chakras themselves <i>per se</i>, but I do recognize the utility of doing ‘energy’ things to yourself and creating a brain pathway to getting information that’s not entirely sensory into mind in a believable way.</p>
