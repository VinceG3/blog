<p>Yes, they do.</p><p>It’s often difficult for females to understand the male sex drive. Suffice it to say that young guys don’t often have a choice about how their feelings for another cause them to act. Their hormones constrain them to a very limited set of options.</p><p>Being fixated on someone and not being able to get what you need out of them is extremely unpleasant. Simply being around them causes great distress. Complete tie-cutting is often the only effective way to move on with your life.</p>
