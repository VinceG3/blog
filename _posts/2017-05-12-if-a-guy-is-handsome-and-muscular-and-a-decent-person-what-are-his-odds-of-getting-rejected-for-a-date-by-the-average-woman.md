<p>I haven’t been rejected for a date in a long, long time. Instead what happens is that they’ll say yes but then we can’t coordinate a date. It doesn’t take much to get me to give up on a budding interaction. But once I put some work into that area that stopped happening.</p><p>The last date I went on, the lady was spectacularly beautiful. Yet I did not ask her for a second. It was clear we were very different people, looking for different things out of life.</p><p>You always have a bottleneck, until you’re done dating. At first it will be just getting girls to talk to you. Then it’ll be getting numbers. Then it’ll be getting dates. Then it’ll be getting second dates. Then it’ll be getting sex. Then it’ll be getting real relationships. Then it’ll be getting what you need in those relationships. Then it’ll be learning how to give the other what they need.</p><p>You’re always going to want something. Just get used to it and relax.</p>
