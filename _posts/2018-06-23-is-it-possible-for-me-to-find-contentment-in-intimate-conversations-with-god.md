title: Is it possible for me to find contentment in intimate conversations with God?

<p>As a mystic, someone who has actually talked with God, talked about <b>all</b> kinds of things with Him, let me tell you, it absolutely was <b>not</b> possible for <i>me</i> to find contentment in <i>just</i> talking to God. Because if there’s one thing that talking to God did for me was to inflame me with the sense that <i>this could be better</i>. I do <i>not </i>have to stay where I’m at. I can have more.</p><p><b>God doesn’t fuck around.</b> He wants to see you succeed, and it can happen <i>shockingly</i> quick if you are ready for it. Like, so quick it’ll make your head spin. Once I got a taste, then there was only one thing I wanted. <b>More.</b></p><p>God doesn’t have limits. He doesn’t want me to have any either. So when I talk to God, God focuses me on getting rid of those silly things. That seems to be the right thing for me to do. Contentment would be the wrong approach. <i>For me.</i></p><p>But it might be perfectly right for you. And it might take you a long time to realize whether you are or aren’t. And contentment’s the kind of thing that you don’t really realize you have until you’ve already had it for awhile. Talking with God can help you with that realization.</p><p>Godspeed.</p>
