title: What are your opinions if I were to admit that I do not believe in race?

<p>My opinion would be that you’re being rather naive.</p><p>Race is a pernicious idea not because some people don’t believe in it. It’s a nasty idea because a lot of people <b>do</b>. You saying you don’t believe in it does absolutely nothing to improve the lives of the people that are oppressed by it, by both people and institutions and societies that do.</p><p>I don’t believe in race either. The whole concept simply shouldn’t exist. But it does regardless. I need to deal with reality, not with what I believe should be reality. And work towards changing that reality for the better.</p>
