title: What made you realize that your existing spiritual practice was right for you?

<p>I’ve never had to make that particular realization. Naturally, when I was young I often wondered whether what I was reading or doing was correct or not.</p><p>But I would never, and indeed have never, wondered about that particular thing. My spiritual practice comes from me. Nobody else picked it for me. I may have accepted guides and mentors at various points in the journey. But <b>I</b> made the decision to accept those people’s input, no one else.</p><p>If you freely pick or decide on something, then that something is right for you. It’s that simple. The decision reflected some deeply held value or wish for you to explore a particular thing. It can’t be wrong.</p><p>Go with your gut. It’s the advice-giver that’s always there for you, that never steers you wrong. It’s where people ignore their guts that they get into trouble, never where they listen to it. Sometimes the gut conflicts with the head, always choose your gut in these instances.</p>
