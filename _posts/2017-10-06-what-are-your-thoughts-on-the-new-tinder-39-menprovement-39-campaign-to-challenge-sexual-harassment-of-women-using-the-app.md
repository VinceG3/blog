<p>I think it’s great. People are going to complain about whether it goes too far, or not far enough, but giving women some tools to deal with harassment themselves rather than being forced to call for help, (Quora’s “approach” to harassment prevention) is, if not just what’s needed, at least a step in the right direction.</p>
