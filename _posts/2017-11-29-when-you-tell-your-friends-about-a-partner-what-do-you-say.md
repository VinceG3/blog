title: When you tell your friends about a partner, what do you say?

<p>I lost my last romance over this issue. Sigh, I miss her.</p><p>There’s a tendency to want to talk out your relationship problems with other people. I’ve learned that this is always bound to be a futile endeavor. They won’t be able to see both sides of it and their help will always be extremely limited.</p><p>Unless you have no ideas of your own at all about how to resolve a particular problem, don’t even bother trying to vent or otherwise complain about a romantic partner. Keep it to genuinely-felt praise. If you don’t have anything nice to say about someone you’re involved with, why are you with them?</p><p>If you absolutely need to talk or vent, do it with someone you trust not to go blabbing to other people, and <b>always</b> do it over the phone or in person, never through text. It <b>will</b> eventually get read by someone that’s not you or the other person. Probably your lover, as was the case with me.</p><p>Say nice things about your lover, both to them and to other people. Give positivity out to the world, and chances are you’ll get to enjoy it in return.</p>
