title: Who is bored of constant &quot;atheist vs. believer&quot; questions on Quora? I doubt either side will change their mind.

<p>I don’t mind them much. It’s kind of annoying dealing with the constant predictability of stated positions, everybody thinks their position is the novel and logical and correct one, but I’ve been on one side of the debate or another for well over a decade now and it seems as relevant as ever.</p><p>I don’t think your goal for any particular argument should be so bold as to actually convince someone to convert to your side of it. I believe instead you should be striving to say something they haven’t heard before.</p><p>I’m so glad that the “logical fallacy” approach to arguing in this space became passe a few years back. Man that could get annoying. You’d spend a ton of time crafting a personally-tailored argument just to be met with “tldr: appeal to authority.”</p><p>I have to say that my own spiritual experiences lead me to fight for the underdog in any such matchup. If on Quora I perceived a bunch of theists trying to beat on atheists, my posts here would be very different. But on the Internet, atheists all seem to be in the overwhelming majority. So I find myself taking apologist positions more often than I would like.</p>
