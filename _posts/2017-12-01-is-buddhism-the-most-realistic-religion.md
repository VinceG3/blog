<p>Please don’t believe the lies sold to you by the self-help industry.</p><p>Buddhist enlightenment is incredibly ill-defined and the different traditions are all over the map. Physical descriptions of the Buddha himself have him as having arms that go all the way down to his knees and having exactly 40 teeth.</p><p>Buddhism is literally all over Asia and if you think there’s somehow more consistency to it than to Western religions, you’re dreaming. It evolves and grows and changes and adapts to the needs of the people that practice it, <i>just like all religions</i>.</p>
