title: Why do many dictionary definitions define atheism as a belief that no god exists, when we just aren&#39;t convinced a god does exist?

<p>Historically, it was nonsensical for someone to claim they don’t believe in something without proffering an alternative belief that they <i>did</i> believe in. People sensibly understood that no one has all the answers, so every position anyone took could be classified as a belief.</p><p>Atheism looked extremely similar to other positions on deity and the supernatural, so people of the day just lumped them all together.</p><p>There’s no real reason to change the dictionary definitions nowadays, because atheists have yet to really differentiate their philosophical position from that of belief. As they say, “nothing new under the sun.”</p><p>Just because you don’t identify a certain way doesn’t mean the establishment can’t or shouldn’t describe you that way if that fits their already-established understandings. It’s their dictionary, not yours. Make your own dictionary if you don’t like it. If Charlie Manson decided he doesn’t identify as a murderer, does that mean that you have to accept it?</p>
