<p>To piggyback on what Halston said, if she shuts you down, the biggest thing that will come out of it is that everyone else in the group will laugh at you for it. If you can take that with a measure of aplomb, then you don’t have to worry about it.</p><p>If you’re desperately afraid of losing your spot in the pecking order, then I’d advise you to not even try because you obviously value group identity more than your personal goals.</p>
