title: You&#39;re in your 30s. How would you invest 350k?

<p>If I were you, in real estate. You can buy maybe four properties at 20% down with $350k, and the leverage you get with four mortgages is insane. You just have to pick the properties and the tenants carefully so you don’t end up with empty properties.</p><p>If I were me, I’d be hiring contract labor for app development. You can get a <b>lot</b> of work out of developers with that kind of money to throw around. But you have to know what you’re doing. Greater risk, greater reward. Realistically, though, if I had $350k in my bank account, I’d pay off my car and buy a condo cash, and just keep doing what I’m doing.</p><p>In short, $350k is a great seed fund for a business. If you’re in your thirties, you’ve got lots of energy for that sort of thing. You could buy a franchise, you could roll your own.</p><p>But buying financial instruments with $350k isn’t a really good use of your time.</p>
