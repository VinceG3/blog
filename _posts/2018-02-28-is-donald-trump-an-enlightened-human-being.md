<p>Of course he’s enlightened! He’s got the greatest enlightenment you’ve ever seen! When he met the Dalai Lama last year, just the greatest guy, the Dalai Lama said to Trump, “man, I thought I was enlightened, but you’ve got the angels singing to you!” Trump’s enlightenment is known by all the religious leaders of all the religious movements of the world.</p><p>I tell you, you can’t find a better enlightenment than the enlightenment in President Trump.</p>
