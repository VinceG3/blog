title: Why does my comment appear at the top of the ‘recommended’ list but nowhere on the ‘all’ list on Quora?

<p>Took me a few weeks to realize this but the “recommended” comments aren’t recommended for everyone, they’re recommended to you. Different people are going to see different recommended comments. Your comments are always going to show up as recommended to you.</p><p>I could get philosophical about what I think about this particular feature, but if I’m going to start complaining about things Quora could do better, this particular feature is pretty far down the list.</p>
