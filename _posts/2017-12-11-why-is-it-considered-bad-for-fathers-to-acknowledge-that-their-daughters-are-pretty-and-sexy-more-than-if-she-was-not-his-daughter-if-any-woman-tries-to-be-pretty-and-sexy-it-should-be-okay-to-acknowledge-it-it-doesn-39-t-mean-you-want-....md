title: Why is it considered bad for fathers to acknowledge that their daughters are pretty and sexy, more than if she was not his daughter. If any woman tries to be pretty and sexy, it should be okay to acknowledge it. It doesn&#39;t mean you want to have sex.

<p>It’s not a question of acknowledgment, it’s a question of what you’re choosing to complement your daughter for. I would hope that she has plenty of commendable traits that you can acknowledge first.</p><p>The rest of the world is going to tell your daughter that she’s sexy. Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Be the mature adult that sees her other qualities too. She’s going to look to you for a model for how men are supposed to treat her. Give her a good one to follow.</p>
