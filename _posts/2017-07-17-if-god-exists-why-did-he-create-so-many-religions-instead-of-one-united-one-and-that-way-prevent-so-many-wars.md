title: If God exists, why did he create so many religions instead of one united one and that way prevent so many wars?

<p>God didn’t create religion, man did. We try to fool ourselves into thinking that God made the particular religion that we follow, but it’s never hashed out that way.</p><p>If you follow the history of religion, the human hand guiding religious evolution becomes absurdly clear. Humans write religious texts, they invent the myths, they alter them when the myths cease to serve their needs.</p><p>No room for God in that process. I’m a huge believer in God, will be until the day I die, but religion? That’s man’s. We’re lucky if we can take it or leave it, throughout history, not many had that choice.</p><p>Spirituality takes the religion out of God. So much better.</p>
