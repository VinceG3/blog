<p>Make a website advertising custom website development. Take the phone calls of whoever calls you. Try to sell them a custom website. Custom sites, those that don't go through WordPress, cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>It will be expected for you to hire a team. Collect at least $20k upfront, take $10k as profit and build a team of offshore developers with the other $10k and hope your client relationship doesn't tank so hard you get sued.</p>
