<p>Any old text editor can be used to type Ruby code.</p><p>What you seem to be after is a way to <i>run</i> Ruby code. Ruby code is run by a Ruby <i>interpreter</i>. Here is a link to a package that provides an execution environment for Ruby:</p><p><a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/" data-qt-tooltip="rubyinstaller.org">RubyInstaller for Windows</a></p><p>You didnâ€™t specify your end goal (like, say, developing a Rails app) so I have to assume that you just want something to execute Ruby against.</p>
