<p>You can and should read the Bible, but donâ€™t expect it to tell you anything real about the Christian point of view.</p><p>In the first place, much of what Christians believe comes from church doctrine, not directly from the Bible.</p><p>In the second, the two Testaments are very different animals. The books of the Old Testament are canon for at least six religions. You can read a <b>lot</b> of different things in those stories.</p><p>You can tell that the authors of the New Testament were Jews and had a deep reverence for Jewish theology of the time, but they were really insistent on setting the new religion apart from Judaism because by the time they got around to putting it to paper, the split from Judaism was already set in stone.</p>
