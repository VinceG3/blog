title: How do I distinguish whether someone is really falling in matured love or it&#39;s just attraction?

<p>Mature people understand that the other person isn’t just a sink for your wants and needs, but also have wants and needs of their own. So rather than just wondering about what they want and whether they’ll be able to get what they want from the other person, they communicate with the other person to find out if they can be what the <i>other</i> person wants and needs too.</p><p>Anything else is just infatuation.</p>
