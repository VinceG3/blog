title: Do you think &quot;friendzoning&quot; is a better way to rebuff someone&#39;s romantic advances instead of flat-out refusal? Why or why not?

<p>C’mon now, think about this carefully. A woman saying she just wants to be friends <b>is</b> a refusal. In what universe is it not? I’m having trouble understanding what it is you want women to do to you if they’re not interested in your game plan for romance.</p><p>You really want them to, as soon as you express to them that you like them and want to date them, say that, no, I don’t want to date you, and in fact, please get out of my life because I never want to see you again? Because that’s what it sounds like.</p><p>Quit setting up “heads I win, tails you lose” situations for the women you’re attracted to. Maybe try being their friend, oh God what a concept.</p>
