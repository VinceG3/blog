<p>It’s somewhat impossible not to. The Bible is a <b>big</b> book, because it’s not actually one book, it’s a huge collection of them. And spirituality rewards deep analysis and meditation. You can’t do that with the whole Bible, there just isn’t enough time in your life.</p><p>Most people read it through once or twice, find their favorite stories, and study those more deeply throughout their life. Even this is a <b>ton</b> of work, it has to be done alongside everything else you do in life. It’s inconvenient as all heck, but it’s worth every second you put in.</p>
