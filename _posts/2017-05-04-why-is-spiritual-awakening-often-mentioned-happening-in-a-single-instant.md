<p>You can’t apply something you just discovered in an instant to your everyday life, all the time. That’s why they call it a journey and not a leap.</p><p>But if you take the journey, then eventually your life consists of many of these leaps. But each one feels new. The old you feels unenlightened, boring compared to your new self, your new mode of being.</p><p>You have slowly but deliberately discarded the past and the future. Doesn’t happen overnight, but it sneaks up on you. Quicker than you might think, too.</p>
