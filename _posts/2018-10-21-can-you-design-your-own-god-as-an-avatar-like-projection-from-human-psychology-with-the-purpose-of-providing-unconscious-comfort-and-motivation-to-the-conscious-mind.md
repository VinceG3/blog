title: Can you design your own God as an avatar like projection from human psychology with the purpose of providing unconscious comfort and motivation to the conscious mind?

<p>The other people in the thread saying “yes this is what all gods are” are missing an important aspect of religion. A deity isn’t just one person’s projection, it’s an entire people’s. Everybody sharing in the belief gets to participate. And the deity provides comfort and a reason to connect to the whole society. A framework to cooperate with. Meaning to engage in.</p><p>Doing it all yourself is bound to not be as fulfilling. Building a community is much harder than just joining one that already exists. If you’re building a community of one, (plus your deity) you have to do all the work yourself.</p><p>It’s not as much fun as you would think. Share your spirituality. It’s hard, but not as hard, in the end, as not sharing it.</p>
