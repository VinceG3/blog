<p>No, that’s called contracting. You’ll need to come to a contracting arrangement with your employer. Just go into your boss’s office and explain that you’re interested in contracting rather than employment. They may be open to the idea. Be sure you jack up your hourly rate to at least 3x what you’re currently getting paid because contractors get a lot less in terms of benefits and income security. Otherwise you’re just hurting yourself.</p><p>Once you have some free time and cash start a company, then have your new client start making out the checks to them.</p>
