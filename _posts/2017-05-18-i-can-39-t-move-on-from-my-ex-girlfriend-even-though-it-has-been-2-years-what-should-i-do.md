<p>If you get to a point where you’ve been pining after someone for longer than you ever were together for, then you really need to realize that this is something that is beyond your ability to fix. I like psychotherapy, I see a therapist once a week.</p><p>Benefit enrollment periods are here, if you have a half-decent health plan, then you can qualify for a Flexible Spending Account, which most therapists will accept. Do the maximum election, the bite of a $400 a month therapy bill is eased considerably by the fact that you can use pretax money to pay it.</p><p>You need to get the most out of your time in therapy, so when he / she asks you to do something, don’t bitch and just do it. She’s a professional, just let her do her job.</p>
