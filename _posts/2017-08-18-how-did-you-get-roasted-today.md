title: How did you get roasted today?

<p>Fun question.</p><p>I moved apartments last weekend, from the 14th floor to the 5th. For some stupid reason I wanted to do it all myself. I was able to get everything but my bed moved, and was lucky enough to flag someone in the hallway to help me move the mattress.</p><p>Thought I was finally out of the woods when it was all done. Nope. A couple of days later my left big toe started hurting like crazy. It literally felt like it was being roasted.</p><p>Went to see a podiatrist and he numbed my toe, then dug out the nail and snipped both sides off of it. Ingrown toenail. Once the numbing wore off, oh my god did it hurt. I stupidly didnâ€™t get my Tylenol 3 prescription filled until this morning, had to drink myself to sleep last night. Thank god for whiskey.</p>
