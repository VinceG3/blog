<p>Do you have the requisite skills? Shouldn’t be hard at all. Show up at the Meetups for your chosen stack and you should be able to line up interviews in very short order. You could also contact me, I’ll pass your resume along to the hiring folks in my company. We hire code school grads and working devs of all types.</p><p>Do you not have skills? Best bet is code camp. General Assembly is highly rated. Companies still snap up code school grads like they’re the last snort of cocaine they’ll ever get.</p>
