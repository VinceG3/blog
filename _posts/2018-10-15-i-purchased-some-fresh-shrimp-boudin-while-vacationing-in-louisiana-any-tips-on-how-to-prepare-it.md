<p>Never heard of Boudin made with shrimp, but in any case boudin is typically steamed, if you have a steamer rack, or boiled if you don’t. Just get a small saucepan, fill it with water, and bring it to a boil, drop the boudin in carefully so you don’t splash boiling water everywhere, and let it get hot.</p><p>Like most sausages, everything in boudin is typically cooked before you stuff it, so all you have to do is heat it up. In a pinch, you can just do that in the microwave.</p><p>Some people eat the casing, I typically don’t. I like to cut it off and just mix up all the insides into a bowl. If it’s been frozen it might need a little kick to fluff it back up and give it that punch, I really like smoked chipolte Tobasco sauce to jazz it up, but if it’s still fresh you probably won’t need it.</p>
