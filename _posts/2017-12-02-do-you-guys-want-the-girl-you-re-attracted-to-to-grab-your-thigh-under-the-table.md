<p>A2A, if I’m attracted to a girl then I want her to touch me. I crave touch from attractive ladies, both intimate and casual. If you touch me in a way I didn’t want to be touched, I’ll likely be very forgiving. But I’ll also make sure you know that I didn’t like that.</p><p>I’m not all guys though. All guys are different. Your particular guy might not like to be randomly touched. I like to say that I learned the language of touch from animals. If they don’t want to be touched, or if they don’t like they way you’re touching them, their body language will reflect that. Their reaction to being touched will reflect it.</p><p>If you can’t read those reactions, then you should just keep your hands to yourself and use your words instead to get confirmation. Even if you can, words are sexy, words are fun. Use them to show how much affection you have for them.</p>
