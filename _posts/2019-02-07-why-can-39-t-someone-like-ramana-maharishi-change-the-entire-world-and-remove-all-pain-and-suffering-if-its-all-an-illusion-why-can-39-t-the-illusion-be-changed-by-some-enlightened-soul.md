title: Why can&#39;t someone like Ramana Maharishi change the entire world and remove all pain and suffering? If its all an illusion, why can&#39;t the illusion be changed by some enlightened soul?

<p>Enlightenment isn’t magic. You cannot use your enlightenment to put gas in your car or food on the table. Similarly, it cannot by itself make other people enlightened. The Buddha’s enlightenment spawned a religious movement, but it didn’t make the whole world enlightened.</p><p>The bottom line is that we all have free will and so that means we all have to find enlightenment ourselves. If someone’s enlightenment is triggered by the presence of another enlightened person, so much the better, but it is not guaranteed and can even be rejected.</p><p>Also, things being illusory does not make them any less real. Illusion means constantly shifting, not that it has no effects on things. It is ego that makes out the constant shifting to be anything more than that, constant shifting. But if the illusion shoots a gun at you, you’ll be just as dead.</p>
