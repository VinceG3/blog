<p>I have written about the Christian rejection of reincarnation before, click <a href="/What-is-the-meaning-of-spiritual-enlightenment-and-why-do-few-people-have-this-Why-not-all/answers/73661565">here</a> to read it. It should give you some historical color.</p><p>To answer the question though, when you intend to teach someone something, you don’t bury it so deep that you have to question where the teachings are or if they even exist. If the Bible wanted to teach reincarnation, it would have just done that and we wouldn’t have to sit around and wonder about it.</p><p>What does Proverbs teach? Wisdom. How do you know? It’s written right there on the first page of the first book.</p>
