title: If you were nice to someone and they started being an asshole to you, what would you need to hear to ever want to talk to that person again?

<p>They’d just have to stop being an asshole. I’m a very forgiving person by default. Even when I was a kid dealing with all the other asshole kids, I learned that people often are motivated by other people around them to be dicks. Catch them when they don’t have assholes around them and suddenly like magic they’re not assholes either.</p><p>You’d have to be way way way more than just an asshole if you want to get me to cut you off.</p>
