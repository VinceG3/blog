<p>You’re not taking the next step. You need to smile, then say ‘hi.” Then start a conversation.</p><p>What, you thought you could build a connection with a pretty lady just with eye games? You can’t, you will have to open your mouth at some point.</p><p>If a girl is looking at you, that means you have her attention. That means your eye game gambit <b>worked</b>. You now need another game plan.</p><p>Does all this seem really hard to you? It is. You know what makes it easier? Fishing in the dating pool that you have easy access to. The girls you see every day, who you can easily have conversations with about random stuff.</p>
