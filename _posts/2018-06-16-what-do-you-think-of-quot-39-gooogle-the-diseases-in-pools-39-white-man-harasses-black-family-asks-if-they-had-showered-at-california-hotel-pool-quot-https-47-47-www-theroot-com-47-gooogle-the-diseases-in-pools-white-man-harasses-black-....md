<p>Holy fucking fuck I hate racism. I hate sexism too. This guy had it both in spades. I know most people wouldn’t step into a situation like this, but I need to make it known, I would have jumped in <b>without hesitation</b>.</p><p>I would have taken the weight of dealing with the situation off of the unfortunate lady that was <i>forced</i> to deal with it and piled it onto this privileged motherfucker, that’s me I’m talking about here, who literally couldn’t give a flying squirrel fuck about that weight. I am goddamned Hercules with this shit.</p><p>I will David and Goliath any dumb dipshit that thinks they can get away with this kind of behavior. You’re going to <i>wish</i> I cut off your head like David did by the time I’m through with you.</p><p>“Hey buddy, why don’t you lay off the lady and go do something fucking useful for once?”</p>
