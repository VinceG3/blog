<p>Unbelievably so. Even those who manage to find the so-called dark night are immeasurably more engaged in life than people who never bother.</p><p>An important caveat. Atheism and materialism are no barriers to spirituality. Your vehicle can be comics and science fiction and movies. The effects are the same and since these don't mess with your inner frames, dark night aspects don't arise.</p><p>They both consider seriously aspects of existence that aren't real, but rather transcendent. Therefore they are spiritual frames and this provide vehicles for personal discovery and growth.</p>
