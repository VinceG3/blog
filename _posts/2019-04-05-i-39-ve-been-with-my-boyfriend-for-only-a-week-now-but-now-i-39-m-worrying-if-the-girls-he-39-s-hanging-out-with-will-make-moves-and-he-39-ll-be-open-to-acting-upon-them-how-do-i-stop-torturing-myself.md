title: I&#39;ve been with my boyfriend for only a week now, but now I&#39;m worrying if the girls he&#39;s hanging out with will make moves and he&#39;ll be open to acting upon them. How do I stop torturing myself?

<p>Talk to him about it. It’s natural to hold on to jealous feelings, but holding on only represses them and repressed feeling tends to lash out in an uncontrolled way.</p><p>These days, a relationship can only work if you can share your feelings with each other. Honest sharing should provoke a return of that same honesty. Figure out where his head is at. Get to know him as a person, not as a piece of furniture that might decide one day that it doesn’t want to live in your house anymore.</p><p>You may find he’s not a trustworthy person. If he can’t be honest with you when you are honest with him, it’s probably not going to work out. You might find out that he’s the most trustworthy person you know.</p><p>But you’re not going to find out whether he’s going to act on any of the mountains of options that being young and social offers him by keeping your mouth shut and only voicing your fears on Quora.</p>
