title: When is love too strong?

<p>When it’s not real and you just think you’re in love. The strength of the feelings results from the mind wanting something so bad to be true that isn’t true that it manufactures what it needs.</p><p>Real love is requited. More mental energy isn’t going to make them love you back.</p>
