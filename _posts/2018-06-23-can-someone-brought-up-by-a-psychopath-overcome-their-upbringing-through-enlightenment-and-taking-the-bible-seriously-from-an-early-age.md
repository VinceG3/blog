<p>One can argue that simply surviving your upbringing is an act of overcoming. Children are not as helpless as popular media makes them out to be. When I was a kid I was quite capable of deception, deception is the most effective weapon anyone who is in a situation in which they don’t have any power can muster. Don’t sell yourself short.</p><p>That said, let me try to challenge your understanding of God. God does not just magically appear in your life just because you picked up a Bible. He was there for you <i>the entire time you were growing up</i>. Pick up a Bible because you want to <i>understand</i> God better, not because you need something from Him. If you need something from God, just ask Him directly.</p><p>Best way is prayer. Recite the Lord’s Prayer out loud, preferably while kneeling, with a candle lit. After you’ve recited your prayer, open your heart to God, ask Him for what you need, and wait for a response. You may not get one the first time you pray. But if you keep doing it, eventually you will.</p>
