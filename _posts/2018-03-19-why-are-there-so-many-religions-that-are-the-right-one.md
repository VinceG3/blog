<p>Because the nature of spiritual belief is that it is formed in the moments in a person’s life where they are most uncertain and scared, and the spiritual revelation fixes all that. So they hold on to it very tightly.</p><p>That means you believe it’s right, and that usually creates the attendant belief that everything else is wrong. But it’s not religion or spirituality that’s flawed, it’s humans.</p>
