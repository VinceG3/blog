title: Does enlightenment have nothing to do with God and the total surrender to Him?

<p>Enlightenment has everything to do with God. You might not be using that word to describe anything happening to you, but if you ever deal with any concepts like, “the infinite connectedness of the universe,” you’re dealing with God. Just two different ways of describing the same thing.</p><p>Similarly, surrender is how you become enlightened. Any other spiritual technique you use to become enlightened, if it’s working, can also be described as surrender. Enlightenment means to give up your ego. Give up, surrender, different words to describe the same thing.</p><p>Once you surrender your ego, your life ceases to be ordered by that ego and gets ordered by something else. What could that something else be but God?</p>
