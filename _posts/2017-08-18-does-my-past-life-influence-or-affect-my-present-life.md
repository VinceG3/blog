<p>Of course it does. When you die, it’s like drifting off into a long sleep. You have dreams, which can be quite vivid and involve things that happened in your life. If you have really strong religious beliefs, you might spend some time in an afterlife. The Christian afterlife can last for a very long time.</p><p>But inevitably you’ll get reborn. It’s just like waking up in the morning, only you don’t remember anything and you have a new body. You’ll eventually forget everything about your old life and proceed anew into the new one. Your personality, interests, and character will be very similar to your last life, because you will be essentially recreating all of that in your new body.</p><p>Only your memories are gone. You didn’t need them anyway.</p>
