title: The girls I&#39;m attracted to aren’t attracted to me. There are girls who like me but I&#39;m not physically attracted to them. I&#39;m already 33, should I just pick one of them because it&#39;s kinda annoying to be single forever?

<p>I don’t have any easy answers for you, I wish I did. In our parent’s day, going so long without getting married was unthinkable. But you were considered lucky if you still liked and loved your spouse after a few years. Most people just paid lip service to the idea and a “happy marriage” was a not-so-funny joke.</p><p>Those days are over. They’re never coming back. What made marriage so ubiquitous was its role in social wealth creation and management. There was less wealth floating around, so it had to be hoarded and parceled out in miserly fashion. The stories my mom told me about her childhood…</p><p>Now we have the unimaginable luxury of choosing who we marry. You are proposing taking that luxury, tossing it in the trash, and recreating the romantic lives of your parents, who chose each other because they well-and-truly <i>had</i> to, all because, well, it’s kinda annoying to be single?</p><p>Screw that. I would much, much, much rather be single than married to someone I don’t love for the wrong reasons.</p>
