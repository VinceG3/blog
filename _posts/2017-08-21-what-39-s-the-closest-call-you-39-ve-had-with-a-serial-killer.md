<p>Not me, but a friend of mine got attacked while she was riding down the Silver Comet Trail. The guy later got caught and she had to testify at his trial. Hereâ€™s a news article link:</p><p><a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/local/ledford-convicted-murdering-silver-comet-trail-cyclist/7pUs4RNqDwQbTBAq8115II/" data-qt-tooltip="ajc.com">Ledford convicted of murdering Silver Comet Trail cyclist</a></p><p>He basically ran out after her and tried to knock her off her bike. She spotted him out of the corner of her eye and was just able to evade him.</p>
