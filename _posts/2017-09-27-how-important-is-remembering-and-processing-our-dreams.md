<p>It’s useful if you have a tough time communicating with and understanding your subconscious mind. Dreams have a language that’s highly suited to the sorts of things your subconscious wants to communicate with you in.</p><p>I wouldn’t say it’s terribly <i>important</i> at all, in that you’d be missing out on life if you just treated them like entertainment. But figuring out how dreams work is a nice little hobby.</p><p>One thing that happens a lot in my own dreams is my teeth fall out. I understand that this is a quite common thing that happens in dreams, and it can cause a lot of anxiety. When my teeth fall out, I’m usually just like, “oh, there they go again,” and I typically wake up shortly afterwards. I get higher than usual dream remembrance when this happens as well.</p><p>Dreams are where your imagination runs away from your reasoning mind. Studying them is studying the underlying structure of how that part of your mind works. You could also study, say, stock market patterns, or different ways to bait a hook when trying to fish. None of these is better than the other.</p>
