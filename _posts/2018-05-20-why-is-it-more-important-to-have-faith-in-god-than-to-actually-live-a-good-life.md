<p>Because it’s through the first that the second is possible. You are human, imperfect, limited in what you can achieve. God is not. Morality is hard. If you try to do it all yourself, you won’t have time for anything else. So trust in God to help you be moral, and focus yourself on enjoying life.</p>
