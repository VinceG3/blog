<p>Oh boy, I’m glad I read the existing answers before shooting my mouth off.</p><p>So let me try to say something that hasn’t been said yet.</p><p>The Great Buddhist Lie, as I like to call it, is that enlightenment means the end of the cycle of rebirth. You should take this claim in the same vein as you take the claim that Moses parted the Red Sea, or that Jesus turned water into wine, or when Obi-Wan said that Darth Vader killed Luke’s father. Allegorically.</p><p>It’s the end of <b>a</b> cycle of rebirth. It’s the end of the phase of existence where your definition and identification are “sharp.” It’s the end of your separation from the rest of existence.</p><p>Does it mean that ‘you’ end when you no longer identify strictly as an individual? Part of <i>my</i> being includes the elevator I ride up on to get to my apartment. Part of my being is all of humanity.</p><p>My <i>experience</i> just centers around my body / mind / awareness.</p><p>Enlightenment has served me, the part of me that remained after I became enlightened in some previous incarnation, and it serves everything else I identify with / as. This means all of you.</p><p>I hope you get some value out of it.</p>
