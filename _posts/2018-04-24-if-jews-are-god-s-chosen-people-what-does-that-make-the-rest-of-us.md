title: If Jews are God’s chosen people, what does that make the rest of us?

<p>The Jewish answer to this question is that we’re <i>Gentiles</i>. Not necessarily good, not necessarily bad, just not of the faith and so we’re not <i>guaranteed</i> a good place in the world to come.</p><p>The Christian answer is to read the Bible a little more deeply and realize that God always intended to bring His message to the whole world and not just one people. Jesus is God’s avatar he sent to deliver this message. Now rather than God choosing a people, He demands that you choose God.</p>
