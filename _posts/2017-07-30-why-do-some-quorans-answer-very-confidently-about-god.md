title: Why do some Quorans answer very confidently about God?

<p>Occupational hazard. The dirty little secret is that belief is, well, belief. It’s not fact, it’s not logical, it’s not rigorous. It’s belief. Yours is as good as mine.</p><p>Believers mostly expect each other to speak as if they know and understand the whole universe through their personal relationship with God. Christians do it, Buddhists do it, everyone who is even remotely spiritual will do it.</p><p>Rigor is neither asked nor expected. Just say your truth confidently to the world. It’s more fun that way.</p>
