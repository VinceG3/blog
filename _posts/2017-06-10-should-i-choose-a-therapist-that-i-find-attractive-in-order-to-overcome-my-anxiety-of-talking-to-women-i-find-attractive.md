<p>It's not a bad idea. You misunderstand transference, it's a key foundation of a working therapeutic relationship. It's really good when you can express your feelings in a safe, welcoming context. You should mention this to your therapist in your first session so she knows what's up.</p><p>On a side note, how do you plan on finding an attractive therapist? Are you just going to keep interviewing them until you finally find one? Choose from a lineup? Genuinely curious here.</p>
