title: What do I do when this girl is bothering me and she is really being annoying? I really don&#39;t like her. I think she doesn&#39;t like me either. I don&#39;t know how to tell her to stop.

<p>One time I was at a bar, talking to a woman. She’s telling a story, and not doing a very good job of it. And she’s just going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.</p><p>I got sick of it and asked her, with a completely blank look on my face, “Does this story have an end?”</p><p>She got mad and stopped talking to me. I turned back to my beer, my mission accomplished.</p><p>Where there’s a will there’s a way. Your mind will come up with a solution, and you just have to go with whatever it is.</p>
