<p>Sure. <b>Sugar pills</b> can cure illness. Not every illness, but many of them. Science still has yet to wrap it’s collective mind around just what placebos do, but recent research has shown that what a person believes can trigger the body to heal itself.</p><p>The will is stronger than the mind, and the mind is stronger than the body. Belief, all by itself, can heal you. Whether that belief comes from meditation, kundalini awakening, or a nice doctor telling you that sugar pills has proven an effective treatment for arthritis, doesn’t really matter.</p>
