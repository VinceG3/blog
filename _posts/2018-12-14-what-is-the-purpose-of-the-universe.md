title: What is the purpose of the universe?

<p>I believe the universe was created, not necessarily by the Judeo-Christian God, but rather by the collective might of all living things that existed before our universe did. I don’t believe that ‘all of creation’ has an intelligent creator, but that our particular branch of it does.</p><p>Being that it was created, our universe must have a purpose. I believe that reason is, essentially, the same reason people play Minecraft, just on a grander scale. To have a sandbox world in which to play in. We are projected fragments of the aforementioned pre-universal beings, any eternal being will want to stop existing eventually, rather than completely obliterate itself, it disintegrates its psyche into pieces and projects them into new vessels to begin anew a journey of learning and growth.</p>
