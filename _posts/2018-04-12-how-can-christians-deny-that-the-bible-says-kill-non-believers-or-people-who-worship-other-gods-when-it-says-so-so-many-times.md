title: How can Christians deny that the Bible says kill non believers, or people who worship other gods, when it says so, so many times?

<p>Nowhere in the Bible does God issue a blanket command on all who believe in Him to kill other people <i>simply because they don’t</i>. Not in the Old Testament, and certainly not in the New.</p><p>The Old Testament does have God commanding people to kill, and his motivations are usually pretty explicit. The pre-Roman world was a kill or be killed kind of place. David hid from Saul for years, and remarkably refused to kill Saul even when God delivered him into David’s hand, twice. (God left it up to David to kill Saul or not)</p><p>God protected you from that world, and in return demanded that you follow His will. When you walked with God, God delivered your enemies into your hand, when you were not walking with God, He delivered you into the hand of your enemies.</p><p>The difference is subtle but very important. You have to invoke God’s wrath before he smites you. Merely being a Philistine or a nonbeliever wasn’t enough. God led many of his own people into slaughter at the hands of Philistines.</p>
