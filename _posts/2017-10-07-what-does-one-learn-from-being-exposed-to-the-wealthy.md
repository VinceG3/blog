<p>How to be an asshole, mostly.</p><p>I keed, I keed. But among the biggest differences between the classes you see is <i>values</i>. When you’re wealthy, you’re used to special treatment. You often look for it in places where it’s not appropriate. This is often the first thing you’ll notice about them. Look at all the question asking about cheap things that wealthy people do and all the answers. Seeing wealthy people do such things sticks out in our minds precisely because of the value difference those things illustrate. We hold our values near and dear.</p><p>If people grow up middle class, and become wealthy, their values remain stubbornly middle class. But those that grew up wealthy, if their parents weren’t careful to teach them appropriate values, then those kids are probably gonna be assholes.</p><p>Values are things you care about more than your own selves and ego. It’s the cause for Jesus saying, “I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</p><p>These things often only get in the way of the rich, but for a lot of not-so-well-off people, it’s all they have.</p>
