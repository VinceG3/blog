title: Why does God create us and put us with so much suffering to grow and be enlightened? What if I don&#39;t want to grow or be enlightened? Can&#39;t we be just free of life, death and suffering enlightenment cycles? Can God just leave us alone and let us be?

<p>You can’t not grow. To not grow is to cease to exist. As far as I’ve been able to determine, that’s impossible.</p><p>But you don’t have to deal with that. You will die eventually. Once you die, that’s it, for you. You’ll get some afterlife time and when you’re done your present incarnation can go join God, while your soul remains and finds another body to incarnate into. Your future incarnation will not remember you now.</p><p>You don’t have to do anything special to grow. Consciousness evolves all by itself, if you don’t want to self-manage, and most people don’t, God can manage just fine all by himself. You can just let go, veg out, and play pubg for the rest of your time here. Not a bad life, your great great great grandfather probably worked in a field his whole life or something.</p><p>And playing video games <b>is</b> meaningful, it does help your consciousness evolve. No, it doesn’t do much to build the world, but there’s other people handling that just fine.</p><p>No need for you to do anything. Just relax.</p>
