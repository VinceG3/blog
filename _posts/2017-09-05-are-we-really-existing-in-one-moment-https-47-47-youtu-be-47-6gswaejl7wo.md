<p>No. The past never really goes away. And the decisions we make affect the future. So our existence spreads out in a cloud across a long period of time. Things you do today can have effects hundreds of years from now.</p><p>I was reading an article about how they found a human child in a cave from 10,000 years ago. Just think about that for a second. Someone finding you thousands of years from now. Scientists trying to discover everything they can about you so that they can gain knowledge. And you did nothing but exist.</p><p>Nobody ever really leaves Earth. This world is the legacy of every living thing thatâ€™s ever lived here.</p>
