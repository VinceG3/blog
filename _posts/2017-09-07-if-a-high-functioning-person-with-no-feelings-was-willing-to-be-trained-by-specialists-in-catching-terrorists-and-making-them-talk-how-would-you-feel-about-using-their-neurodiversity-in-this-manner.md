<p>I’d be interested to see what training techniques were used. Seems to me that the trainers would have to be psychopaths themselves in order to do a good job? Needless to say, I’m not convinced about the real-world feasibility of such a plan.</p><p>I’d say it’d be an interesting plotline for a movie, but no way could Hollywood make a movie about psychopathy interesting enough. It would devolve pretty quickly into a standard thriller.</p>
