<p>Hi Salvine, I did some digging, I don’t have Outlook Live myself, so I can’t tell you from personal experience. But what I found is that Microsoft does not offer this functionality. My suggestion to you would be to use an email service that respects what you want to do with it.</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/omessaging-oim/in-hotmail-how-make-profile-invisible-by-default/c634613b-8e6a-4a2e-afd2-7924f294af34" data-qt-tooltip="microsoft.com">in hotmail how make profile invisible by default</a></p><p>Alternatively you can try using an email client to access your mail rather than the online one. I’ve used Thunderbird in the past, it’s a good one:</p><p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" data-qt-tooltip="mozilla.org">Thunderbird — Software made to make email easier.</a></p>
