<p>Probably. Depends on how good you are at hiding your feelings. Most men are horrible at it. Good news is, if you’re attracted to her, then chances are a lot of her clients have been, so she knows how to deal with it. You’re really probably never going to get any action with her so I’d just try to chill about the whole thing.</p><p>My therapist is totally hot and totally married. I’ve never mentioned my attraction, though I’m sure she’s noticed me looking at her legs. It’s not something I want to drag into therapy so I leave it alone and she returns the favor.</p>
