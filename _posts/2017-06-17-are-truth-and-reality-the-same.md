<p>Truth is a valid narrative. Valid means that logic is available, nothing unfalsifiable can be considered true, not even God. If logic is present, and the logic holds, then it's valid.</p><p>Narrative means you're dealing with a <i>story.</i> A story is a sequence of events as told by a person. There is a beginning, middle, and end. Stories have points they're trying to get across. Truth convinces you off those points.</p><p>Reality is a component of truth. It's part of the logic regime that allows one to tell whether it is actually true or not. Reality is simply that which is not imaginary. It can't be the construction of mind. We perceive the physical world to be real, but God cannot see it as such, as the world is part of the mind of God.</p><p>Reality can exist in multiple minds, just not in one. America is an idea, but it's a real one. People can affect reality, but it's not real if they are its source. If you have a story or some other creative thing, it's not a real creation until someone else witnesses it.</p>
