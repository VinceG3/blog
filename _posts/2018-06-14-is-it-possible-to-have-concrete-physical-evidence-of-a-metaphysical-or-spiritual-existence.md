title: Is it possible to have concrete, physical evidence of a metaphysical or spiritual existence?

<p>No, it’s not.</p><p>Well, not entirely. It’s possible, but only after you’ve already opened your heart to mystical realities. I’ve obtained physical evidence, but that physical evidence was not concrete.</p><p>But before I tell you that story, let’s talk about <i>Polar Express</i>. A boy takes a train to go see Santa Clause on Christmas Eve. It’s a grand adventure, and at the end of it, the boy receives a special gift, a small hand bell, seemingly broken without a striker, but it’ll ring if he shakes it and puts it to his ear anyway. The idea here is that as long as he keeps the adventure in his heart, as long as his heart doesn’t run cold, he’ll be able to hear the bell.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f299a28c2c576315aa088efc89f98f78"><p>He narrates his future with the bell as such: "At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years past it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe."</p><p>Would such ‘evidence’ fit your expectations? Would that bell be physical and concrete enough for you? Think about what you’re asking for here. If it were physical and concrete, it wouldn’t be metaphysical or spiritual.</p><p>Now to the evidence that I’ve obtained. I was developing psychic abilities using a technique called the muscle test. You can learn about the muscle test by clicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypKUST0azUQ" data-qt-tooltip="youtube.com">here</a>. I was using the test to communicate with some entity. I had a old laptop that developed sticky keys in one area. The entity directed me to push energy into the keys.</p><p>So I put my hand near the keys, focused for a bit and ‘pushed’. When I tapped on the keys, they had unsticked! Well, for about 15 seconds, then they re-stuck. I re-did it a few times then decided it wasn’t worth the trouble to develop the technique into real telekinesis.</p><p>When you get right down to it, if you have a spiritual technique to do something that you also have a mundane technique for, the mundane technique is <i>always</i> going to work better. And I could have just taken the keyboard off and cleaned it. I wound up leaving it alone, and I think eventually the stickiness cleared itself up.</p><p>Let’s zoom out a bit. If you did indeed have a magical wonderland at tap, would you really want to make it into a mundane existence with rules and consequences?</p><p>Would you open Pandora’s Box?</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-527dc4963bec0e868795958f404d5b15"><p><i>Polar Express</i>, like all good mythical tales, plays in the space between the mundane and the divine / magical. These tales just aren’t doing their job properly if they don’t scare the everloving crap out of you. Do you <i>really</i> want to rely on magic to save your life when you screw up?</p><p>No, the fact that the world is mundane and not magical, the fact that we don’t have to rely on knowing literally everything <i>in order to just survive</i>, is a real blessing. The fact that <i>we</i> have to approach <i>God</i>, and not the other way around, is exactly the way it has to be.</p><p>The real reason for why divine and magical realities don’t present themselves to you rather than forcing you to find the doorway and go through yourself is because <b>it’s better that way</b>. It really is. The people that don’t want to deal with those realities <i>don’t have to</i>. And the people that do can find a nice, leisurely learning curve without getting tossed into a shit-your-pants-scary adventure whenever the gods have the desire to.</p>
