title: God is an imaginary figure, but there is in fact a ‘spiritual’ entity out there that is willing to give (us) some sort of support in a way. Could this be true? If so, why is he willing to help us, what&#39;s in it for him&#47;it&#47;her?

<p>Oh what a hilarious question. Voltaire truly was right. If God didn’t exist, humans would have found it necessary to invent him.</p><p>God is a near-inevitable concept, no matter what direction you approach from. Unless you set out with the specific purpose of avoiding turning your spiritual beliefs into belief in God, as the Buddhists did, then you’re eventually going to end up with an nonphysical, omnibenevolent, omnipotent deity that you might as well just call God because for all intents and purposes, that’s exactly what it is.</p><p>Lesser deities wind up all getting their power from the big G. Do enough meditating and thinking, and it really can’t be any other way. Sure, you can accept Abrahamic scripture or you can reject it, but no pantheon can get taken seriously without a divine ‘source’, and posited metaphysical regimes that aren’t completely materialistic must also have a Source of all things.</p><p>The idea falls out of mysticism like apples from a tree..</p>
