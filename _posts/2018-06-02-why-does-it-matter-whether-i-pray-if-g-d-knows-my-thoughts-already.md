title: Why does it matter whether I pray, if G-d knows my thoughts already?

<p>The prayers really aren’t for God, they’re for you. You’re putting yourself into a receptive frame of mind to accept God’s grace.</p><p>I used to have a friend that was perpetually hard up. I’d help him out from time to time with some dough. I always asked him a few questions that I already knew the answer to before I ponied up cash. First I always asked how much he needed, (as much as you can spare) and what do you need it for. (because he fucked something up)</p><p>If I didn’t ask these questions, guaranteed he’d start taking my generosity for granted. If he starts to look at me as an ATM and not a friend, then not only will I have lost a friend, but at that point nothing I do is ever going to help him rise above his situation.</p><p>It didn’t work, I had to completely turn my back on him before he could find it in him to turn his life around. Not even prayer can help some people.</p><p>But you, gentle seeker, aren’t so far gone. Once prayer puts you in a state of open acceptance, God can fill your mind and spirit with, not just His grace, but also ideas and solutions for your problems.</p><p>We tend to forget the need to put ourselves openly and humbly before God, and prayer reminds us. God cares because He wants the best for us.</p>
