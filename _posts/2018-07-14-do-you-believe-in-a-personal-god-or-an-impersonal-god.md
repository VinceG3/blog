<p>The phrase “God is all things to all people, comes to mind.” God does not have limits, when God is one thing, it does not stop Him from also being the opposite of that thing. God can be both omnipotent and powerless at the same time, both omniscient and blind, both omnibenevolent and sociopathic. Both finite and infinite.</p><p>We cannot <i>fathom</i> God. We can’t fathom the full extent of God.</p>
