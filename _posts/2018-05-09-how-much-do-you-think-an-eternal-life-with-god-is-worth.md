<p>Worth? As in, how much money would I give to you in order to enjoy eternity with God?</p><p>Oh buddy, you have no idea.</p><p>God made all that money. He made the world that they pulled all that money out of the ground to make. He made asteroids out in space that hold more material wealth than we’ve ever pulled out of the ground. He made the Sun, without which life could not have evolved.</p><p>But he didn’t just stop at one Sun, he made millions, just in this galaxy. And he didn’t stop at one galaxy. There are more galaxies that we can see than there are stars in this one.</p><p>What is wealth to God?</p><p>He’s already promised eternal life to <i>everyone</i>. Not just people that believe. Anyone that wants it. Not just on this world. Any world around any star that hosts intelligent life. Any of the unimaginably countless beings in the unimaginably countless worlds.</p><p>There’s absolutely nothing you could imagine that could possibly stack up to that.</p>
