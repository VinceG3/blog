<p>First read <i>Power vs. Force</i> by David Hawkins. He articulates a 1000 point scale of human consciousness. Once you have a map in your head then you can obtain a calibration.</p><p>The best way is to have two people that aren’t you use the muscle test calibration method. It will be described in <i>Power vs. Force</i>, but the basics of it are that one person extends their arm out and holds a question in mind, then the other person tries to press down on the outstretched arm.</p><p>It will either go down easily or it won’t hardly go down at all. This is a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ response. Treat strong as yes and weak as no. Start with “Is &lt;your-name&gt; at 100 consciousness according to the 1000 point scale of consciousness articulated by David Hawkins?” If you get a strong response, go with 200. Keep it going at 100 point intervals until you get a weak response. Then start with tens. Then ones.</p><p>In this fashion, you can obtain a numeric measurement of how much consciousness you have. With study of the Hawkins scale, you should be able to understand what that number means.</p>
