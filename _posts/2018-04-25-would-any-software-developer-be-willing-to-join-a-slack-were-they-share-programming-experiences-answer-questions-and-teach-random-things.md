<p>As a software developer myself, I’d wonder how such a community would be any better than Hacker News, or my local Slack which already offers the opportunity to connect with devs in my city.</p><p>If there is already one in your area, think hard before you start another one. Usually, it’s not a better way to contribute to your community than just being the agent for change to see your desired interaction in the one that exists already.</p><p>Reason is, building a new community is almost always a lot more work than adding to an existing one.</p>
