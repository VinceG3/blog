<p>Break up with her. Don’t put yourself or her through a relationship where you just can’t muster up positive feelings towards her.</p><p>You could also try talking to her. Be honest, direct, and try not to blame her for your hangups. If you keep blaming her then there won’t be anything other to do than break up because otherwise you’ll be asking her to change for you.</p>
