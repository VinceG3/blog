title: I suddenly hate programming but I can&#39;t get any job other than software development, what should I do?

<p>Do like I did and go work in construction for 8 years. You’ll eventually rediscover your love for programming. If this doesn’t appeal to you then your issue is with the whole concept of ‘work’ and you might just want to take a nice long vacation and come back to it with a fresh mind.</p><p>Alternatively, you can pick a software stack and specialize in it. Once I put a much-needed end to my construction phase, I decided I didn’t want to be bothered with the endless procession of new Javascript frameworks. So I just didn’t bother learning Angular and only applied to jobs that didn’t ask for one.</p><p>I stayed at a Rails job for two and a half years that didn’t require a whole lot of learning. It was just maintenance. After six months I was basically solving the same issues over and over again. It was, honestly, kind of boring.</p>
