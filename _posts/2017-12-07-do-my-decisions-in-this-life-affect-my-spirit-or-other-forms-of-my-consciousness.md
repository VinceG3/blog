title: Do my decisions in this life affect my spirit or other forms of my consciousness?

<p>Of course they do. The life you lead and the choices you make are the highest expression of meaning you create.</p><p>Some people get a little taste of the “outside” through mystical work and they get to thinking that just because the world outside the Earth is exponentially bigger and more complex, and that they can explore it, so obviously it’s this other world that’s the “real deal,” we’re just over here slumming it with all the unenlightened people.</p><p>I’ve met many many people with this mindset, though they wouldn’t have put it in so many words. It’s a bit sad to see. They constantly complain about their lives and crow about all the awesome spiritual experiences they’re having.</p><p>This is why I like Stoicism so much as a life philosophy and practice. It deals with the immediate crappiness of life and trains you to take life’s pummels gracefully. It’s also palatable to atheists and more immediately accessible than Buddhism.</p>
