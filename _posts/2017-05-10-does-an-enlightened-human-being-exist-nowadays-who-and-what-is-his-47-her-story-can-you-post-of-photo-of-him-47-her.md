<p>The way I like to think of it is, just like Jesus Christ absolved and forgave us our sins, the Buddha made enlightenment possible for all of us.</p><p>I think eventually enlightenment will be the norm and not the exception, and everyone will move on to the newest, shiniest spiritual concept.</p><p>I think right now there are enlightened people everywhere, who don’t know what enlightenment is, they just managed to pick up enough ambient spiritual energy and knowledge to where they fell easily into the state.</p><p>Achieving enlightenment gets easier and easier by the year. The whole thing has developed an inertia of it’s own and is like a snowball rolling downhill.</p>
