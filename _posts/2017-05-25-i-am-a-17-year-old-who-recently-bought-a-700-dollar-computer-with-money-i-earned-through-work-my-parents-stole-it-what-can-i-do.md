<p>Let this be a lesson to you to get your priorities in order. If your parents don’t like something, your first objective is to get out from under your parents. You shouldn’t have bought the computer, you should have saved the money to move out with. Buy your computer after you have a roof over your head where your shit isn’t in danger of getting stolen in.</p>
