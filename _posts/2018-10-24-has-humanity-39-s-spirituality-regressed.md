<p>There are two senses in which to ask this question.</p><p>First, you can ask if fewer people are spiritual than before. I would say this is 100% true. In hindsight it was inevitable, religion’s role in society, first and foremost, was a vehicle to promote collaboration between people, at first at the individual level, and, with the advent of multi-polar Christianity, at the society level.</p><p>Once we figured out how to collaborate using rules that didn’t have to involve shared culture, that shared culture started to stagnate. Especially once it became clear that heavy-handed tactics backfire just as heavily once threats lose their potency.</p><p>Teaching creationism in schools is just stupid in a modern world, but religion had throughout history been the only institution willing to educate children at all.</p><p>The other sense is in if religion as an epistemic body has regressed, are we in a “dark age of spirituality?” I would say definitely not. The advent of modernity has provided for an endless variety of spiritual ideas to germinate and flourish. With more people talking to each other than ever before, spiritual modes of thought have been evolving at a breakneck pace.</p>
