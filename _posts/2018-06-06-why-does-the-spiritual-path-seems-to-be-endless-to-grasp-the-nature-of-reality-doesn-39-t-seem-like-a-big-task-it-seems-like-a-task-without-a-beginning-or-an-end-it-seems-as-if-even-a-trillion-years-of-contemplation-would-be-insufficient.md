title: Why does the spiritual path seems to be endless? To grasp the nature of reality doesn&#39;t seem like a big task, it seems like a task without a beginning or an end. It seems as if even a trillion years of contemplation would be insufficient.

<p>Oh it gets even worse. Reality can be distinguished from existence. Imagine that everything you think, everything you <i>can</i> think, everything that <i>can possibly be thought</i> by you, is just a drop in the bucket. The three things, present, future and possibility, are but one dimension of reality, and there are infinite dimensions of reality to existence.</p><p>There are more stars in the sky than there are grains of sand in the desert. We still have no idea how to even begin to estimate the number of life-bearing planets there are, and thus sentient races all with their own dimensions of reality to contemplate spiritually.</p><p>Sometimes it seems to me like even God has trouble with it, and our goal is to help Him with the task of taming it.</p>
