title: Could you explain to me, the logic behind saying that an introvert is not necessarily shy?

<p>So, I’m an introvert. I prefer to have my social interaction in certain ways and settings. In person or in small groups with people I know well. Give me the right setting and you wouldn’t guess I’m an introvert. Give me the wrong setting and you won’t even know I’m there.</p><p>Introversion is commonly expressed as “where you get your energy from and what drains you.” Whereas shyness is usually expressed in fear-terminology. When I am not feeling energized by the social setting, it’s not that I get afraid to interact, it’s just that I prefer not to. I can push myself to, but unless I have a compelling reason to, I just won’t, preferring to wander off to do my own thing.</p><p>I cannot imagine a social situation that would cause me to feel fear. Uncomfortable, sure. Fear, not at all.</p>
