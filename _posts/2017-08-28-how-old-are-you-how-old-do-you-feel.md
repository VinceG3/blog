title: How old are you? How old do you feel?

<p>I’m 33. I feel billions of years old. Some time after my spiritual awakening I started to feel a visceral connection with my eternal self. As I got to know and understand this connection, identification slowly passed onto that self and detached from my current body / mind. I merely inhabit this body and life for the time I have.</p><p>If and when I die and pass on, I’d like to live forever in this body / mind, hoping for aging to be solved in my lifetime, but if not I’ll just move to another body, inhabit the mind, and rebuild my current existence as best I can. I’ll have this experience again of coming to terms with the eternal, and return once more to my cycle of growth. Very interested to see which outcome arises.</p>
