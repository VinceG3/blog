<p>I’m going to be a contrarian and say money. You need enough money to be able to buy enough convenience so that you don’t feel like you’re overworked all the time. Without that baseline, it’s hard to find enough surplus time and energy to devote to a romantic relationship.</p><p>The nice thing is, you can learn to get by on less. And you can learn to thrive through resourcefulness. Resourceful people can solve problems and create value without much in the way of starting materials or cash.</p><p>Once you have a surplus of resources, you can start trading those resources for money. There is only one thing worth spending money on, and that’s time. The time you buy with your money is going to be precious and scarce. This is the time you devote to your romantic relationships.</p><p>So while money is ultimately more important, you buy the capacity for love with your money. You can’t have love without the time to enjoy it. Therefore money is more important.</p>
