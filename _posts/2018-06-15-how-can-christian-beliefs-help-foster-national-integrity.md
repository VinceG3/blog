title: How can Christian beliefs help foster national integrity?

<p>By realizing we committed an <i>abomination</i> unto the Lord in the subjugation and slavery of black peoples that we brought over here, whipped, forced to labor, and forced to bred, and calling for a collective <i>atonement</i> of that national sin.</p><p>This action would involve working with black leadership to devise an appropriate reparations regime which, in my opinion, should involve no less than sending every single black child born up to a cutoff date no later than January first of next year to college for four years. We can use the same rules to determine who is black that Jim Crow used.</p><p>Yes, the Bible does discuss slavery. But go read your Leviticus and tell me how chattel slavery fit that description. Iâ€™ll be waiting over here.</p>
