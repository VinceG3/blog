<p>Enlightened beings all will have different spiritualities. Sure, on the Internet we wind up discussing the same ideas, like nonduality and such, but when you get right down to it, spirituality is just way way larger than the concept of nonduality can circumscribe. Thereâ€™s Christian enlightened folks, Muslim enlightened folks, Jewish enlightened folks.</p><p>No spirituality is prescribed by enlightenment.</p>
