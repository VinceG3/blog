<p>I’ve read of this sort of thing happening, the people involved were quite well-off. The therapists and the patients were both well-aware of the limitations of the treatment plans and would get together outside of of sessions and trade ideas. Not surprisingly, a lot of people found this improper. If you want to read about it, the book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ICN31SA/" data-qt-tooltip="amazon.com">The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships - Kindle edition by Neil Strauss.</a></p><p>One of my best friends is a psychotherapist, and the one that I see is a friend of hers. My therapist once floated the idea of contacting my friend and getting her perspective. I said to knock yourself out. She said she wasn’t sure about the professional ethics and would think about it. She never followed through on it.</p>
