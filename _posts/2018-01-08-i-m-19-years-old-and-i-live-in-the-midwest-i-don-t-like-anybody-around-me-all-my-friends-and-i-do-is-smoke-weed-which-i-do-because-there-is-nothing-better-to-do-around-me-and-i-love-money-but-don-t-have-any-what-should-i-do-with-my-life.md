title: I’m 19-years-old and I live in the Midwest. I don’t like anybody around me, all my friends and I do is smoke weed, which I do because there is nothing better to do around me, and I love money, but don’t have any. What should I do with my life?

<p>My personal answer to this question was to join the military. Wasn’t my kind of life, but the two years I gave to it were worth the discovery.</p><p>You love money, so obviously the military is out for you. What I would do is find a sales job. Get good at it. I had two sales jobs in my early twenties. I did Cutco knives, and later on Mazdas. Neither job lasted long but taught me important lessons about relating to humans.</p><p>And the money will make it easy for you to move.</p><p>Life in a small town or city is nothing like living in a big city. It’s much, much, much easier to make money and make good friends in a decently-sized city. After I left the military, I moved to Atlanta, still here after 12 years.</p><p>You can move back out when you’re ready to start a family and your parents are getting older and need you to look after them.</p>
