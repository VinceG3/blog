<p>Can’t say it any better than Terry Pratchett.</p><blockquote><p>There is a very interesting debate raging at the moment about the nature of sin, for example,” said Oats. “And what do they think? Against it, are they?” said Granny Weatherwax. <br>“It’s not as simple as that. It’s not a black and white issue. There are so many shades of gray.” <br>“Nope.” <br>“Pardon?” <br>“There’s no grays, only white that’s got grubby. I’m surprised you don’t know that. And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. That’s what sin is. <br>“It’s a lot more complicated than that . . .” <br>“No. It ain’t. When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they’re getting worried that they won’t like the truth. People as things, that’s where it starts.” <br>“Oh, I’m sure there are worse crimes . . .” <br>“But they starts with thinking about people as things . . . ”</p></blockquote>
