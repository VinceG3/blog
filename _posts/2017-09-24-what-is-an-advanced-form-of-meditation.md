title: What is an advanced form of meditation?

<p>Basic meditation is just sitting down and doing nothing. Watch your thoughts come and go. Set a timer or just go until you want to get up.</p><p>Advanced meditation adds visualization. Do something while you are sitting there. When I was getting started it was eating an apple. Not a real apple dummy, just picture yourself eating it. Really get into it. Feel the juices running down your hand.</p><p>Doesn’t matter what you do really, but at least when you’re starting out you want to have a plan for what you want to do while you are meditating. You can “open your chakras,” climb the 1000 steps to heaven, get in a room with your “higher self” and have a conversation, or if your imagination isn’t up to the task, just sit and commune silently with it.</p><p>All meditation is just one form or another, you’re either visualizing or you’re not. You can try regulated breathing or whatever, but it’s not necessary and the effort can get in the way.</p><p>So two ways, active mind or passive. I call active meditation more advanced because you’re engaging more of your mind rather than just observing it. You also need good observation discipline before you can really start getting the most out of visualization.</p><p>Of course you can mix and match, it’s your life, do what you want with it.</p>
