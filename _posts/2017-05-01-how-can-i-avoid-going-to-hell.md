<p>You have to care about being a good person.</p><p>You can’t banish hell just by not believing in it. Hell is more than a lake of fire.</p><p>Hell is having 12 different relationships one after the other and not being happy in any of them.</p><p>Hell is never being able to find a good job because you just can’t get along with others.</p><p>Hell is starting businesses because you can’t find a job and failing at all of them because you kept screwing them up.</p><p>Hell is finally saying you’re sick of trying to make money legally, and then breaking the law, and having to deal with more and more unsavory characters.</p><p>Hell is getting caught and going to prison.</p><p>The Catholics have this fascinating idea called <i>eternal sin</i>. Eternal sins are sins that God will never forgive. But God’s forgiveness is completely unlimited. This means that every single sin can be forgiven. Eternal sin happens when <b>you don’t want to be forgiven</b>.</p><p>Mere mortal sin can be absolved of. The absolute worst a human being can do, God will forgive you.</p><p>But he can’t forgive you if you don’t want to be.</p><p>Hell is the punishment you create for yourself through your own actions.</p>
