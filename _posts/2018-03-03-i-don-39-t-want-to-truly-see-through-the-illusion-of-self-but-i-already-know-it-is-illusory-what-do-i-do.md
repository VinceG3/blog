<p>Don't do anything. You don't have to investigate the nature of things like the self if you don't want to. It'll be right there waiting for you when you finally feel like taking another look.</p><p>This isn't the Matrix, you don't have to make a deal with Agent Smith to get back to comfortable delusion.</p>
