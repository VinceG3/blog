title: I made a flavorful Mac and cheese on the stove. I put it in the crockpot to keep warm for a few hours and then it was nearly flavorless. What happened?

<p>My guess is that you either overcooked it, destroying the taste and texture of the cheese, or you dried it out. It's possible adding water or milk will fluff it back up to its former glory.</p>
