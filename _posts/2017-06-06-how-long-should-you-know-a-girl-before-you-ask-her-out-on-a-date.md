title: How long should you know a girl before you ask her out on a date?

<p>A date is a specific type of interaction that you have that allows for romantic connection despite all of the craziness and busyness of modern life. It’s a way for two people that have already verified that they’re attracted to each other to shove the world away for a few hours and spend time together.</p><p>I don’t think young people should be wasting their time and money on dates. There are plenty of cheaper ways to build a romantic connection.</p><p>What people that ask this question seem to be have trouble with is <i>verifying</i> mutual attraction. You haven’t yet made a romantic connection with her and are hoping that the asking of the date and the acceptance will suddenly propel you into the romance zone.</p><p>Unfortunately it doesn’t really work that way. You need to be constantly communicating, verifying, and sharing romantic interest, otherwise the connection will eventually go stale. Ask her if you can kiss her, not if you can take her out on a date.</p>
