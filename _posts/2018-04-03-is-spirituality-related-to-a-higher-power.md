title: Is spirituality related to a higher power?

<p>All spirituality attempts to escape the self. But it winds up instead exploring and trying to improve and transform the self. For example, in Christianity the thing outside the self you’re trying to escape to is defined as Jesus. But the act of trying to be a good Christian involves appropriating aspects of Jesus.</p><p>Buddhism has you investigate the self with the goal of enlightening, or reducing the ‘heaviness’ of self to the point where it no longer exists.</p><p>All spiritual roads lead back to the self. It’s what you’re traveling ‘through’ that marks the difference between traditions. Being that the end goal is transformation of self, the ‘higher power’ always winds up resolving back to self.</p>
