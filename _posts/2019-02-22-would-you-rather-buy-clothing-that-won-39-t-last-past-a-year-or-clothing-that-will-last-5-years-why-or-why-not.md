<p>Hey Celine, neat question. Personally I want a mix of both. Style gets stale after awhile. Wearing the same thing over and over again makes me feel like I’m stuck in a rut. Every few months I get an urge to just go out and buy a few new articles of clothing.</p><p>If my clothes never wore out, then I’d lose one reason to switch things up. But I do want some stylish clothes that I can always go back to, like going back home.</p><p>The only thing this doesn’t apply to in my mind is shoes. I want those to last forever. Sadly, they wear out faster than my clothes because I walk so much and I have short fat Fred Flintstone feet that don’t fit into normal sizes. I’m eventually going to buy custom shoes and just hope they’re comfortable enough.</p>
