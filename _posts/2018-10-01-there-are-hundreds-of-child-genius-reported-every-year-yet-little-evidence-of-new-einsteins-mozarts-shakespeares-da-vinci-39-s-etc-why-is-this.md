<p>That sort of genius is usually recognized posthumously. Society’s attention span is smaller than the possibility space that genius can operate in. If someone doesn’t come across a genius’ works and then promote it in such a way that it becomes viral, that genius will never become famous.</p><p>The reality is, intelligence and capability still needs luck in order for recognition to happen. Some people we’d consider to be geniuses prefer it that way. They don’t want to be recognized. They’d just prefer to keep doing what they’re doing unimpeded. Another reason why it so often is recognized posthumously, dozens to hundreds of years after death.</p>
