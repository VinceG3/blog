<p>Because beliefs emanate from deep in a person’s being. A lot of people build their entire lives around them. To criticize them is to basically tell them that they shouldn’t exist.</p><p>You need to learn how to be tactful around people’s deeply-held beliefs. It’s like telling a dog-lover that you think puppies are stupid and they just deserve to be turned into fur coats. Or just stay away from people’s beliefs if you find this to be too much work.</p>
