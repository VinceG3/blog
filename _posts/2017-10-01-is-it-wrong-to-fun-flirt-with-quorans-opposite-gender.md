title: Is it wrong to fun flirt with Quorans (opposite gender)?
date: 2017-10-01

<p>I have had a lot of fun flirting on Quora. It’s a nice diversion and makes everyone feel nice.</p><p>But at the end of the day, even if you do it right, all you’re doing is leaving yourself and some lovely other person profoundly dissatisfied. Unless you have the unbelievable luck to find someone on Quora that you can legitimately date. Long-distance dating is for those with both the resources and the inclination to <i>fly yourself or the other person over so you can spend time in meatspace</i>.</p><p>In theory, I could do this. In reality, it’s never gonna happen until I start making quite a bit more money. Unless I can put plane tickets in the same mental category as ordering a pizza, it’s just going to be a real tough sell. And I’m not there yet.</p>
