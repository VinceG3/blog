<p>No. Don’t listen to your friends. If you keep learning Node, then you’re learning web development. I never got jobs in 99% of the technologies I figured out how to use.</p><p>And yes, you actually can get a job in Node. They’re out there. Not as prevalent as, say, Rails jobs, but there is a job market with &gt;0 jobs in it.</p><p>When I was starting out, I loved Ruby but thought I wouldn’t be able to get a job with it. Within 6 months of starting my career I had my Ruby job.</p><p>Keep pushing forward and never stop learning and growing. If you can do that you’ll never hurt for interesting and meaningful work.</p>
