title: Do many atheists accept the message of the Jesus myth (love your neighbor, turn the other cheek, etc) without accepting the divinity of it?

My parents bought an encyclopedia when I was around 12 or so and while the encyclopedias themselves I almost hardly touched, I did go through much of the supplementary material and among them was collections of stories, including <i>Aesop’s</i>.</p><p>At the time I was struck by the structure, which felt to me to be patronizing. Why should these stories all have morals? It felt a little off-putting, why would these stories try to teach me something? I know right from wrong, right?</p><p>Fast forward a few years. I’m reading Final Fantasy 7 fanfic. By this time I’m thoroughly steeped in atheism. Some of these stories are really good. A lot of them are total garbage. What separates good stories from bad? Well, for one, good stories seemed to have a <i>point</i>. You understood what characters were trying to do. Their trials and lessons <i>meant something</i>.</p><p>What does this mean, for a story to mean something? It took me 20 more years to figure out. It happened just this last Christmas. I was watching an adaptation of <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. It struck me just what authors were doing when they composed these tales.</p><p>I have yet to read the original Dickens, but the movie adaptation I watched was magical, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge just came alive. What makes it so heart-wrenching is that it’s impossible to not see a little bit of yourself in Scrooge. Being forced to relive something you forgot a long long time ago, that played a crucial role in making you who you are, that’s just one of the powers of stories.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2b1234ed29ba9eb9a5e93f8399e60362"><p>Forget about Jesus, forget about God. Just think of all these things as <b>stories</b>, stories that remind us of who we are and where we came from. Jesus is a character, not a God. God is a character, not someone who will force you to burn in Hell if you don’t do his wishes.</p><p>Read the Bible as literature. It’s a little difficult, you might need some help understanding it. Fret not, there’s lots of resources available right here on the Internet to help you do that.</p><p>Here’s something to get you started:</p><p><a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-confidence-ego-and-humility-explained-in-one-3000-year-old-story/" data-qt-tooltip="thoughtcatalog.com">Everything You Need To Know About Confidence, Ego, And Humility Explained In One 3,000 Year Old Story</a></p><p>The “message of the Jesus myth” as you put it is nothing more or less than Christian <i>values</i>. The ideas of redemption, faith, brotherhood, <i>as Christians teach them,</i> are the same things that <i>make stories good</i>. It’s nice and comforting when the good guys win and the bad guys lose. What makes a good guy good and a bad guy bad? What does it mean for the good guys to win? If you like stories where the bad guy turns good in the end, that’s a classic Christian redemption arc.</p><p>It’s all, right there, in the Bible. And all the surrounding myths, such as the Greek legends that the Bible undoubtedly drew from.</p><p>I can see what atheists might be trying to say right now. “No Vincent, these are <i>universal</i> ideas. Everyone likes a good redemption arc!”</p><p>It feels universal only because you don’t have a lot of cultural literacy. Sure, you’ve probably watched some anime. But I bet if you took a trip over to Asia the culture there would not feel very universally compelling. It would need explanation. And I would bet that the anime that you <b>do</b> like, has a lot of Christian-derived elements in it, put there by Japanese storytellers who were fascinated by Christian myths. And it’s those Christian elements you find familiar and steadying.</p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a62fb767b19b4eeb8b9391eaf7806ef0"><p>Just like I bet someone born and steeped in Eastern culture would need <i>David and Goliath</i> to be explained. Just like you need the Bible to be explained. It feels alien. Different. But Americans have distanced themselves from the Bible and the stories in them.</p><p>So the answer to your question is that Christian myth goes <b>way way way</b> deeper than most people reading this probably think. It has influenced and perhaps dictated <b>the very way in which you enjoy stories</b><b><i>.</i></b></p>
