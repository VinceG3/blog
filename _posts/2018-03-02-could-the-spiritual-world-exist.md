<p>Sure, but it’s not what you think.</p><p>Any time you add a possible completely new direction to go you add a dimension to the space. Humans can’t effectively process dimensions much past 4. So if you try to bolt on a spiritual dimension to our normal existence your mind won’t be able to keep up with everything.</p><p>You have to slow everything down, consider spiritual reality in pieces. For weeks, I mused over the question, “what would it mean for a non-physical entity to be real?” There are a lot of aspects to that question, a lot to go over and think about. And that’s just one aspect of spiritual existence.</p><p>If you let your mind just wander and decide based on what sounds good, which is what most people do, then you’re limiting your exploration of the spiritual dimension to a tiny subset.</p>
