<p>Probably a lot more self-aware and confident than you think. Probably more than you are, too. Religion focuses your mind on eternal truths. Without temporal, worldly matters getting in the way, you can focus on what really matters. You can drive out a deeper understanding of the world and human behavior.</p><p>Your average young veiled Muslim lady knows more about the world and the people in it than you ever will. The things she sees, the insights she possesses, could make you cry for days.</p><p>When you’re in your forties, wondering where the hell your life went, after two marriages you just couldn’t see yourself suffering through a third, she’ll be seeing her kids off to college and looking forward to spending the rest of her life traveling with her husband and doing satisfying and edifying work for her community.</p>
