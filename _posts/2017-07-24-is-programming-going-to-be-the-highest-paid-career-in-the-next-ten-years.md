<p>Of course not! Pretty sure CEOs, NFL players, and management consultants will always make more, assuming concussions don’t spell the end of professional football in the next 20 years.</p><p>What coding is is the new factory jobs. We’re in the middle of a new Industrial Revolution, only instead of cars and steel getting made, it’s websites. There is an insatiable need for new talent. And it won’d be going away anytime soon.</p><p>During the Industrial Revolution, when a factory came to town, it completely transformed the local area. Not everyone got a job in the factory, but there’s a lot more money flying around. If you were lucky enough to get in, and work your way up to a place of respectability, then you could go from being a nobody in your town to being someone.</p><p>So it is with programming. Almost everybody I know that is making decent money is doing it in software. There’s such a huge demand for software workers that you don’t actually need a college degree to get your foot in the door. I still recommend it though because it makes it so much easier.</p>
