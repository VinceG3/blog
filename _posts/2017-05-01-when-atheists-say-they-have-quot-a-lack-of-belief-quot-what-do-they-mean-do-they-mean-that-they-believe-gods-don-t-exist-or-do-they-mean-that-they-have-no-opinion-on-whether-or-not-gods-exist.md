<p>It means “please don’t bug me with this silly nonsense.” They haven’t thought deeply about it, don’t want to, and are content to just deal with what’s in front of them.</p><p>Don’t ask for intellectual rigor from atheists on this question. They’re just not up to the task. They think your question is stupid and will not take it seriously.</p>
