<p>I was at Varasano’s Pizzaria awhile back and got to meet Jeff Varasano. He makes the best New York / Napolitano-style pizza you’ll ever find in Atlanta. He is a serious pizza geek and you can get a sense for just how much he cares about pizza, you can read his recipe page here:</p><p><a href="http://www.varasanos.com/PizzaRecipe.htm" data-qt-tooltip="varasanos.com">Jeff Varasano's NY Pizza Recipe</a></p><p>While I was there, Jeff was futzing about with the payment system. My pie came to me at the same time as his meal came to him, delivered by his girlfriend. It was a McDonalds Big Mac. I told him how great my pizza was. He said his was too, and no, we can’t trade.</p>
