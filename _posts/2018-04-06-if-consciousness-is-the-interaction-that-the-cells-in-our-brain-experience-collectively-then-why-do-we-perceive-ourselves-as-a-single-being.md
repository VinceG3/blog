<p>Mostly because we evolved to. It would be difficult for an organism to coherently use its brain to work out solutions to problems while it’s having a constant identity crisis.</p><p>That said, there are various things you might want to look into. First is the <i>split-brain</i> condition. This is when the <i>corpus callosum</i>, a neural superhighway connecting the halves, gets severed. Evidence indicates that the two halves of the brain start to develop independent personalities. The various parts of the brain cooperate to create a singular identity.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Split-brain - Wikipedia</a></p><p>The other is a postulation called <i>bicameral mind.</i> It’s not taken very seriously by psychologists today, but it’s good as an idea for how spiritual beliefs developed in the times before technology.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Bicameralism (psychology) - Wikipedia</a></p>
