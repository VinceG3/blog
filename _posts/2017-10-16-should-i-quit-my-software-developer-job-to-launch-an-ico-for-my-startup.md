title: Should I quit my software developer job to launch an ICO for my startup?

<p>What are you hoping to get from the ICO? Money to sustain yourself while you flesh out the business model? How are you going to guard yourself from the possibility that you won’t get enough money to continue your lifestyle? What’s really keeping you from just doing the ICO while you’re holding down the job?</p>
