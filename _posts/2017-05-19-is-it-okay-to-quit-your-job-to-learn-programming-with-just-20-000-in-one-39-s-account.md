<p>I wouldn’t recommend it. It could work, or you could blow through your life savings and have no job and no money at the end of it. (I hope you saved it, otherwise you’re blowing through someone else’s, who loved you enough to give it to you)</p><p>Keep your job, and spend the money on a code bootcamp, and attend while holding down the job. But don’t spend the money if you don’t have to, swipe it on a credit card and pay it off after you get a job.</p><p>Look, I know what you’re thinking, you’ve got $20k burning a hole in your pocket and you hate your job. You really want a new career but are daunted by the amount you need to learn. There’s tons of free resources out there to teach you what you need to know, so why not treat learning as a job?</p><p><b>This is extremely foolish.</b> Everybody thinks they can become a nerd overnight. You can’t. But you <b>can</b> retrain into a new career. People do it all the time.</p><p>You have all the resources you need to do that. Instead you want to fritter away $20k so that you can pretend to be a nerd.</p>
