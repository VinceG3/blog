title: What are good reasons to see a therapist?

<p>I see a therapist. I have no interpersonal problems, no psychological problems. The biggest reason why I see one is because I make a lot of money and I can afford it.</p><p>You see a therapist because you want to work on some aspect of your personality or psychology and you don’t want to leave it all up to your own devices. The first thing a therapist is going to ask you is what you’re looking to get out of therapy. I worried a bit about this question because I knew she was going to ask and I didn’t know if my answer was going to be good enough.</p><p>I shouldn’t have worried. She immediately agreed that the reason I gave (to help me build deeper relationships with people) was an excellent one and we set a date for our first session.</p><p>The reasons you listed, overthinking situations, low self esteem, wanting to be more assertive, and the feeling that you’re a drama queen are <b>fantastic</b> reasons to see a therapist.</p>
