<p>Really not much in the way of standards regarding this.</p><p>The best thatâ€™s come out so far is <a href="https://12factor.net/" data-qt-tooltip="12factor.net">The Twelve-Factor App</a>.</p><p>Opinions on deployment and operational support vary widely. We use Elastic Beanstalk at Great Big Story, whereas I use Capistrano to Linode on my personal projects and at my last job.</p><p>I use Passenger whenever appropriate for my web server.</p><p>If the lack of standards scares you, then you should just stick to Java.</p>
