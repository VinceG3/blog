title: Why do most spiritual teachers always talk in absolutes? Wasn’t there a time when they too were apparently caught in duality&#47;suffering?

<p>The honest answer is that it’s just easier to deal in absolutes than it is to dive into tricky situations. You can tell good spiritual teachers from bad by whether they can work in concrete examples to point towards transcendent truths. Bad ones just say a bunch of high-minded crap and expect you to believe that it’s wise. If you ask them specific questions, they won’t have the ability to actually help you, they’ll just spout more generic crap.</p>
