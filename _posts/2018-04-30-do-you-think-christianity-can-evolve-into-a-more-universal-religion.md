<p>How much more universal do you want it to be? Anyone can decide that they’re a Christian. Christian churches even form ministry branches that dedicate themselves to spreading the gospel worldwide so as to appeal to the broadest possible population. Catholics and Protestants and Orthodox of different cultures and belief structures all manage to get along under the same roof.</p><p>Doesn’t get much more universal than that.</p>
