title: If by naming something or everything, we are creating division, which is the nature of duality. Then why do enlightened people talk about compassion as being fundamental, even though the nature of attributing meaning to &#39;something&#39; is divisive?

<p>You’re dealing with conflicting dogmas here.</p><p>The reality is that Buddhism is not the consistent “philosophical religion” you want it to be. People who are enlightened have ‘merely’ completed a path of mysticism and do not have much more insight than anyone else on things that matter to you. People interested in Buddhist mysticism are better thought of as spiritual nerds than supermen.</p><p>Buddhism has brought lots of great ideas to the spiritual marketplace but please don’t hold it out to be more than it is. The specific contradiction you’re pointing to is but one of many and is part and parcel of the spiritual realm. To argue these points is to participate in the dogmatic process.</p><p>Ignore them and just meditate on it yourself and come to your own conclusions. That’s the right way to approach Buddhism.</p>
