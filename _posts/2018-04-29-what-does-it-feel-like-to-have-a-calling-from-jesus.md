<p>Exhausting, yet fulfilling. You realize you just can’t live life the same way other people do, and often times you’re just stuck until you figure out the way forward. Nobody understands you and eventually you just learn to deal with it.</p><p>Jesus himself was a carpenter right up until he started preaching the gospel. Can you imagine what life must’ve been like for him? To have this presence in your head guiding and teaching you so you can guide and teach others? No way could he have a normal life with normal relationships, everything is super-special, super-poignant, super-filled with meaning and resonance.</p><p>Then in that moment where God starts acting through Jesus, he’s like, finally, this is starting to make sense. But though things now make sense, you just don’t have much in the way of free will anymore. Before you had it, it just didn’t make sense to do anything other than chase the muse. But now the muse leads you.</p><p>No, a calling is not an easy thing to live with at all.</p>
