<p>The solution to your problem is planning the future. You’re unmotivated because you don’t know what you’re working towards. So figure out what you’re working towards.</p><p>Write out on a sheet of paper (personally I use a text editor and save the files to Dropbox) a list of goals. Pick goals with the power to motivate you. Traveling is a really good one. I took a two-month long trip to Colombia in my mid-twenties. It was great, the perfect reset I needed.</p><p>Whatever it is, work out how much money you’re going to need to do the thing that you wanted. Then just start saving.</p><p>While you’re working, think about the thing and everything you want in it. Visualize yourself doing it. Imagine all kinds of great things happening because of it.</p><p>Think further out. What medium term goals would you like to accomplish? Plan those out and start saving for those too.</p><p>Once you have a good idea for what you want out of life, something that will motivate you to push through adversity, now start making decisions like whether to quit your job or not. Will quitting really make it easier or faster?</p>
