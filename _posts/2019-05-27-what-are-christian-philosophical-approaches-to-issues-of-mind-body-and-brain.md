<p>I rather like Emanuel Swedenborg’s approach. He’s a Lutheran mystic that was active in the 1700s who had a near-death experience one day and kept the state for the rest of his life. He states that the process of free will is mediated by the spirits of everyone who has ever lived on earth, they have good and evil influences that one can listen to or ignore.</p><p>It’s noted that Swedenborg was also a scientist, and came up with the concept of neurons about a hundred years before anybody ever discovered the actual cell type. He was greatly fascinated by brain anatomy and had prescient insights long before anyone else thought to study it. He characterized Heaven as a human body (the ‘divine design’) and a person’s thoughts as their spiritual body. He describes spiritual warfare as happening in each individual human and is the process by which individuals find themselves.</p><p>Highly recommended, the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q14EcEwQVQ" data-qt-tooltip="youtube.com">offTheLeftEye</a> exists to make Swedenborg’s writings accessible to a lay audience.</p>
