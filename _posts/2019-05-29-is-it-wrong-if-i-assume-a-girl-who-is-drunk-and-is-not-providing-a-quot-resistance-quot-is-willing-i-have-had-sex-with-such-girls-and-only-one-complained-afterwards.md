title: Is it wrong if I assume a girl who is drunk and is not providing a &quot;resistance&quot; is willing? I have had sex with such girls and only one complained afterwards.

<p>This is a bit like drinking and driving. It’s wrong, you know it’s wrong, but you do it anyway and 99% of the time nothing comes of it. It’s that one percent that ruins your life, and if you’re lucky the consequences are only legal.</p><p>When you’re sufficiently drunk you’re unaware of just about everything you’d normally be aware of. While willingness might be present, that’s not the same thing as fully-informed consent.</p><p>It’s one thing to get drunk together and have sex together while you’re both drunk. I’d go so far as to say you’re both responsible for those consequences if and when they arise. Having sex with a drunk person <i>while you yourself are sober</i> is perilously close to rape, if not in the legal sense, at least in the moral. You’re taking advantage of someone who isn’t in the same head space, doesn’t have the same mental faculties, as you do.</p><p>I used to drive drunk. I’ve had drunken sex. I don’t do these things anymore. In the case of driving drunk, I moved to a walkable part of town. For sex, I simply don’t have sex with someone the first time unless we’re both sober. The risks simply aren’t worth it.</p>
