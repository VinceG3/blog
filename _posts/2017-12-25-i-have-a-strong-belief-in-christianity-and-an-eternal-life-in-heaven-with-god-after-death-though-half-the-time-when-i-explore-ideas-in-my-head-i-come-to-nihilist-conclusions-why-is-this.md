title: I have a strong belief in Christianity and an eternal life in Heaven with God after death. Though half the time when I explore ideas in my head I come to nihilist conclusions. Why is this?

<p>You just need to keep exploring.</p><p>I call things like nihilism, materialism, solipsism, to be like the minor black holes of mysticism. They attract way more attention than they should, because our minds don’t see them for what they are. They’re just pitfalls that you can fall into from time to time. When you fall into them, you have to muddle around in the darkness for awhile until you snap out of it.</p><p>The experience of falling into one of these traps kinda inoculates you against falling into that particular trap again. But you reach another level when you can realize that all of that sort of thing is not a real destination, so you can avoid them consciously rather than rely on the subconscious.</p>
