<p>The family unit is important because it provides a structure on which people can build wealth. Sharing a living space and dividing up and specializing in tasks frees up time that would otherwise be spent having both people do those things.</p><p>Sure, I suppose two people could get by by cohabitating without marrying, but there’s nothing really holding that bond together. A breakup can mean dozens of years of wealth accumulation getting destroyed.</p><p>The pair bond older than humanity, but marriage as a social and legal institution is only as old as the civilizations that made it possible. It’s just really really natural for families to all want to work together and build together.</p><p>With religions brought theological edification, but that’s a minor side-show to the social benefits of working together to build shared wealth.</p>
