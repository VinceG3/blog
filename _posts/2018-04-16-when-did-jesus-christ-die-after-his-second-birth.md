<p>It’s stated in the Bible that Jesus <i>ascended</i> into Heaven, this means he did not die, and rather levitated straight through the firmament and into Heaven. This is held to have happened 40 days after the resurrection according to Acts.</p><p>He also was not born twice. He was born once, died once, then was resurrected. Jesus’s new body was said to have been fully material, in that He could be touched, but could also appear and disappear.</p>
