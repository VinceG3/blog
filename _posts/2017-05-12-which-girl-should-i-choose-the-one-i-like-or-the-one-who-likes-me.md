<p>Neither. You need a girl you like that also likes you. Until then you’re just playing around. Interact with the one you like, and let the one who likes you interact with you. Be honest with yourself and these other girls. Eventually you’ll find yourself in a situation where there’s mutual attraction, either with one of these two girls or with a different girl entirely.</p><p>But don’t play at a relationship. It’s not fun and it’s not healthy. Play outside of them.</p>
