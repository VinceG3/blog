title: Since Lafayette is the &quot;capital of Cajun country&quot;, is it still common to hear French spoken there?

<p>Oh no. It’s been over 15 years since I last heard anybody speaking conversational Cajun French. It was in Lafayette but it was my great grandma talking to my grandma. My great grandma lived out in the country, and my grandma only spoke it with my great grandma. She spoke English everywhere else.</p><p>Cajun French lives on in idioms and exclamations. The language itself is all but dead. The people that still know it only ever have a reason to speak it with people who are more more comfortable with it than English. And I’m fairly sure they’re all dead now. If not they’ll be out in the country.</p>
