<p>Could be inexperience, could be past trauma.</p><p>In my case it was trauma. One day when I was around nine, my babysitterâ€™s husband came home early and raped her in front of me. To this day I have difficulty with intimacy. It took 2 years of therapy to just get to the point where I could realize the significance of that event.</p><p>I hope in your case you just need a few more encounters.</p>
