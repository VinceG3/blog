<p>It’s possible to do <i>something</i> meaningful regarding consciousness growth in your lifetime. In my estimation only so much can be done. The real reason behind this is that as you change your mind, your willingness to accept yourself and the amount of growth you’ve achieved also goes up. This is just part and parcel of the surrender of ego.</p><p>There’s no need to do it all at once. Existence is amazing, even if it can never be fully perfect.</p>
