title: A girl asked me to a dance, and I said yes to her. She’s been really hyped, but now I’ve changed my mind about going. What would be the best way to tell her? She will not take this easily.

<p>If you make a promise to somebody, keep that promise. You’re not going to get much in the way of assistance from others to follow through on a crappy course of action.</p><p>“I want to kill my wife, would Quora please tell me the best way to kill my wife?” isn’t going to get much in the way of sincere responses.</p><p>You really don’t have a leg to stand on here. You said yes to her because you cared about how she felt and because you wanted her to feel good and right about <i>you</i>. Not following through will more than reverse those good feelings.</p><p>Just put on some nice clothes and go to the fucking dance.</p>
