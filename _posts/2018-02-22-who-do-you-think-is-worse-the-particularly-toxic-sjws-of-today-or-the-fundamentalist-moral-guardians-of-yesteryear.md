<p>My opinion of the social justice movement soured when I read a convincing argument that the whole phenomenon is vastly increasing the costs of college by forcing administrators to keep a multiple of the amount of legal resources on hand to deal with disputes than before.</p><p>This, coupled with the tendency of students to treat college as a luxury good that they’re paying for rather than a learning experience is causing them to raise far more disputes and escalate them when they don’t feel those disputes are heard. One feeds into the other, making a vicious cycle.</p><p>I don’t know how true it is, but it would be really ironic if it turns out that the boomers didn’t destroy the vitality of this country after all, it was young people doing it to themselves.</p>
