<p>The largest price you can say with a straight face. Stay at that price for a week, if nobody hires you, drop it by ten percent and try again. Eventually you'll get someone to hire you. Raise it by five percent every time you complete a significant project until people stop hiring you. Then drop by ten again and repeat the cycle.</p><p>There's no need to obsess over this at all.</p>
