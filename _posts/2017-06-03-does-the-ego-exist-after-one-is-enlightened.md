title: Does the ego exist after one is enlightened?

<p>What happens when you get enlightened is your mind <i>unfolds</i> in a million different ways. Nothing that was there before goes away, but because there’s a whole lot of new stuff there to explore, the ego part is deprioritized and ceases its death-grip on your conscious mind.</p><p>What we call ego in this context is a bunch of preprogrammed responses for bad things that happen to you. So say you stub your toe on your coffee table. A programmed ego response might be to wonder who moved the stupid table.</p><p>After enlightenment, new ways of responding to that situation become readily accessible. You might suddenly get engrossed in feeling the <i>texture</i> of the pain that you’re experiencing. You might go through the programmed ego response, but completely recontextualized so that you can laugh at it.</p><p>The way in which ego responds to events is usually pretty one-dimensional. The way enlightenment responds is more like a fractal adventure through the universe of possibility. Only it’s not just stubbed toes that provoke such an adventure, everything does. In fact, the stubbed toe was probably a continuation of a discussion you’re having with the universe, and this was the universe’s way of making a point.</p>
