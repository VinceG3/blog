<p>Yes, you’re incompatible. I see people on Quora all the time try to fool themselves into thinking a relationship without sexual gratification can work. I’m not strictly saying it can’t, but you’re setting yourself up for a <b>lot</b> of dissatisfaction and disappointment if you try.</p><p>Incompatibility issues can be worked through, but you have to have a <b>much</b> better reason to want to work through them than “I just don’t want to have to be single.” If you’re young, with no kids, nothing tying you down, do yourself a favor and don’t sell yourself short.</p><p>Trust me on this, relationships are hard enough even when you are compatible.</p>
