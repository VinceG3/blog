<p>Everybody asks me that! No, we’re not related, except maybe very distantly. Every Guidry in Louisiana descended from <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Claude-Guidry-dit-Grivois/6000000007106293231" data-qt-tooltip="geni.com">Claude Guedry</a>, who lived in French Canada before they were all kicked out. A few of his grandsons made it to Louisiana, and all Guidrys descended from them. I have no idea how close he and I are, I’d have to know his genealogy to find out. But the name is quite common among Cajuns.</p>
