title: If you like someone&#39;s personality and brains, but the physical attraction effectively is a 0 out of 10, is a relationship with them worth pursuing?

<p>No. Look, you’re going to get a lot of lonely people out there who are deluded enough to think they can “change your mind” regarding attraction and sex. And a lot of silly people who think they’re sapiosexual.</p><p>But if you’re asking this question, then you’re not a sapiosexual, you’re just someone who likes brains along with beauty. Nothing wrong with that, just don’t mislabel it and give people false hope. You need physical attraction, otherwise at some point you’re going to wake up and find that you’re not really fulfilled in your relationship.</p><p>Worse, there won’t be anything you can do about it but break up. It’s going to be ugly and dissatisfying. And unnecessary because you should have known better.</p><p>Physical attractiveness is the very first indicator of romantic compatibility and you would be a fool to not listen to it.</p>
