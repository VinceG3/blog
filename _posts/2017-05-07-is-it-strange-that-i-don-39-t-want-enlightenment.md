title: Is it strange that I don&#39;t want enlightenment?

<p>Enlightenment is strange and scary. Not wanting enlightenment is normal. Wanting enlightenment for most people is thought of as an escape from a life they hate.</p><p>Actually pursuing enlightenment (not just wanting it) is super-rare. Of course because the Internet connects people together it gives you the impression that there are tons of them out there. But it’s actually really uncommon.</p><p>We all have a path to walk. People who become enlightened in their lives do it because it’s their path to walk. I’d say that most people that it happens to never heard about or studied what it takes. They were just ready and it was their time.</p>
