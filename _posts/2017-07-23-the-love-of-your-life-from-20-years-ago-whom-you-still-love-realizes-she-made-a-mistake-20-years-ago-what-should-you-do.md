<p>Get back together with her. You only live once.</p><p>I read a book, <i>How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia</i>. The main character was unable to stay with a woman he’d fallen in love with, but they managed to stay in touch over the years. They had sex a grand total of three times over both of their lives.</p><p>When they both got old, she came to live with him, and they finally got the kind of relationship us in Western nations take for granted. Brings me to tears to think about it. Didn’t last very long before she developed a health problem and died.</p><p>Capture these moments while and when you can.</p>
