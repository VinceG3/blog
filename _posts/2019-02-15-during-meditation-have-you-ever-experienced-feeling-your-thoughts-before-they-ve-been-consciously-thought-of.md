title: During meditation have you ever experienced ‘feeling’ your thoughts before they’ve been consciously thought of?

<p>Yes, essentially what’s happening is what we consider our thoughts is really just extremely strong brain activity. The brain activity is weak before it is strong, and emerges from a kind of ‘noise soup’. Meditation quiets thought and focuses you on the soup / fog / primordial chaos.</p><p>Once you can witness thought coming from this fog, you can further quiet yourself and just feel the fog. Eventually the ‘texture’ of the fog can be ‘felt’ and experience unconnected by past thought can be had.</p><p>The weird thing to contemplate is that this experience you’re having that’s ‘pre-thought’ is still just normal experience. What’s happening is your brain is inverting, flipping around on itself, you’re giving it a great big stir.</p><p>Healthy, fun, accomplishes the same goal as psychedelics without making you super-weird.</p>
