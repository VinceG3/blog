<p>I am God. I love myself, so yeah, me and God are tight.</p><p>I conceive of God as a massive energy that self-directs into any form it wants. God can be Jesus, it can be the mountain, it can be me. God can exist, or not exist, it’s up to God to choose.</p><p>I am God, God is me. God is also you, but I am not you. In this world there is separation between things. But you don’t have to separate them in your mind.</p>
