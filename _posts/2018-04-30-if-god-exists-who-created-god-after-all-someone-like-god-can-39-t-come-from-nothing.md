title: If God exists, who created God? After all, someone like God can&#39;t come from nothing.

<p>My current theory is that God is a <i>composed</i> entity that is made up of individual consciousnesses in the same way that individual neurons make up your brain.</p><p>God slowly evolved an unimaginable amount of time ago, and still evolves to this day. The entity creates universes and the universes evolve life, life eventually becomes conscious, then sentient, then the sentient consciousnesses eventually join God. God is an amalgamation of all consciousness to have ever existed.</p><p>Just an idea.</p>
