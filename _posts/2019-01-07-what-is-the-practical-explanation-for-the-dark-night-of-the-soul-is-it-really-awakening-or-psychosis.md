title: What is the practical explanation for the dark night of the soul? Is it really awakening or psychosis?

<p>The Dark Night can only happen after a spiritual awakening, until then it’s indistinguishable from random emotional downswings. Essentially what’s happening is your being is being forced to deal with and accommodate it’s own inherent limited-ness.</p><p>The reasons you get into spirituality are not why and how spirituality helps you. When spirituality inevitably lets your conscious mind down, the Dark Night has you rebuild a version of the self that isn’t reliant on the fact that you <b>need</b> spirituality to do something so specific for you.</p><p>It’s deep, open-soul surgery. If you’ve been doing lots of visualization meditation and encouraging it to leave the meditation session and enter into mundane existence, it can appear to have psychotic elements. But this is pretty rare and not a whole lot of people actually do strong visualization.</p><p>Instead you’ll just feel really crappy all the time, and none of your spiritual techniques will help you reclaim that happy high that you had discovered upon awakening.</p><p>Embrace the suck. Eventually it’ll pass and your spirituality will work again. You’ll reach even deeper, more sublime states now that you have surrendered a lot of your false aspects.</p>
