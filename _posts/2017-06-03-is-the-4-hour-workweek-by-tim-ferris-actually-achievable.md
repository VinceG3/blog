<p>Of course it is. But the thing people don’t realize about Tim is that a) he went to Princeton, and b) he’s the biggest workaholic I’ve ever seen.</p><p>To get your four hour workweek, you need to put in more hours than you’ll ever be able to count building the business so that you can scale it back down so you can spend 4 hours a week maintaining it.</p><p>People say that it’s not working hard, it’s working smart. Well, working smart can take you very far, but to build a <i>business</i> you <b>also</b> need to work hard. Working smart isn’t enough.</p><p>The reason you have to do both is to build and maintain a <i>competitive advantage</i>. You need to spend a lot of time learning how things like e-commerce works. Then you have to learn about the thing you’re actually selling. Then you have to actually sell it to people.</p><p>There are so many context switches involved in making this work that trying to get it done in a smart, lazy way is just setting yourself up for failure.</p>
