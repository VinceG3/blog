<p>I’ve thought a lot about this and I’ve come to understand that hurt feelings come from <i>unilateral</i> decision making. First off, you don’t know what she wants from you. She might well be thinking the exact same way about you, but the way in which you go about telling her can easily lead to hurt feelings.</p><p>The way through this is to tell her how you <i>feel</i> while leaving your <i>plan of action</i> open for discussion. You’re just not ready for a relationship right now. Girls can handle this, heck, most of them are probably used to it.</p><p>But if you tell her you don’t want a relationship right now, and then also tell her you don’t want to see her anymore, that’s a different kind of decision that you’re making for a different reason than you’re telling her. That’s going to make her feel cheap and used.</p><p>My suggestion to you would be to not be afraid to exercise a little romance, even with someone you’re not really that into. You liked her enough to jump into bed with her, you should like her enough to be a gentleman about it in the morning.</p><p>There’s a middle ground between shutting down a girl cold and jumping into a relationship with her. Find it.</p>
