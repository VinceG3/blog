title: What’s stopping people from stealing the Bird or Lime scooters?

<p>I took a Bird to eat dinner at a Mediterranean restaurant that I sure didn’t want to walk to but didn’t want to take the trouble to get in my car and drive to. I got to talking to the guy running the place, good friend of mine.</p><p>He really hated the things. He told me he routinely throws the scooters people park in front of his restaurant in the dumpster, and was waiting on an order of locks that he was going to attach to the wheels.</p><p>People are leaving them parked right in front of his door, riding up on his outside customers and asking for money, then cursing them out when they don’t get any, and generally making nuisances of themselves.</p><p>So the answer to your question is obviously, “nothing.” Very curious just how much money is going into breakage on the things at the corporate level.</p>
