<p>Because the point of fashion isn’t to turn you on.</p><p>Fashion is a giant idea melting pot where designers get together every year and try to come up with more interesting things to do with clothing. All sorts of considerations are taken into account in order for designers to do their things, and the sheer variety of ideas that make their way into fashion demand extremely regular ‘canvases’ to ‘paint’ them on.</p><p>One designer might be harkening back to 1730s fashion, another might be exploring new metallic materials that reflect light in a different way than we’re used to.</p><p>It’s a very insular world and you need to follow it for some time before you can start to understand the dynamics at play.</p><p>The fashion world exists in codependence with the rest of the world of clothing, and the point of clothing is not to turn men on, but to make you look interesting to everybody. The ideas that fashion spawns eventually make their way into boutiques where one outfit can cost many hundreds to thousands of dollars and eventually to Target.</p>
