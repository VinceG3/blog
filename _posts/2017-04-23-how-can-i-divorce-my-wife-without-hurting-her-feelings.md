<p>Oh have fun with that. I’ve been to Colombia three times, love the place. Colombians are a feisty people.</p><p>I can’t help you with your mom, but if you’re in Atlanta, I could maybe mediate. By mediate I mean get nice and drunk with her while she vents out her hatred towards the silly <i>puta</i> who used her and then threw her away. Then she can laugh at all the silly dirty Spanish sayings that my teacher taught me in Cartagena when I was there 7 years ago.</p><p>Then I can offer her a place to crash and watch her find a replacement for you in about 20 minutes at one of the many bars down the street.</p><p>Colombianas are fun.</p>
