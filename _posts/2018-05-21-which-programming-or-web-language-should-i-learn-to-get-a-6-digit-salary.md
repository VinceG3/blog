<p>Your ability to command a six-figure salary depends less on your skills and more on where you are. Six figure development salaries are really only common in big cities in extremely well-developed nations like the US. If you’re trying to break in, you should be moving to one of these job markets <i>before</i> you start trying to get a job.</p><p>I’m not saying it’s not possible to get a great job and either move after or have them relocate you, but a company is only going to take a chance if you have credentials like a Computer Science degree. Simply trying to learn the skills and get a job while not being physically located there is making an already-uphill fight even steeper.</p>
