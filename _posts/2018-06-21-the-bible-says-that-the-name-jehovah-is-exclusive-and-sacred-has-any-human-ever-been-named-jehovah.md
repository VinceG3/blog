<p>While there’s no way to answer the question in the negative definitively, given that just about every name in the Bible is given to many many people, <b>except</b> for Judas, even <i>Delilah</i>, my guess is probably not since the Bible was written. The name would hang over your life like an albatross.</p><p>I can think of only one exception here, and that's Asia, which doesn't have the same cultural attachment to Christianity as the West, so I can easily see how it <i>might</i> happen.</p><p>Edit: nevermind, people are indeed that silly: <a href="https://www.mynamestats.com/First-Names/J/JE/JEHOVAH/index.html" data-qt-tooltip="mynamestats.com">https://www.mynamestats.com/Firs...</a></p><p>The Hebrew version of Judas is ‘Yehudah’, which is a fairly common first name. In the Christian world though, trying to ascertain who is named after Judas is complicated by the existence of St Jude, one of the Apostles. Someone dug into census data <a href="/How-many-living-people-are-named-Judas">here </a>and indeed found unfortunate children named Judas.</p><p>So obviously it will happen.</p>
