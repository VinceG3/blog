<p>Share your emotions and feelings with them. Don’t share them all, and keep it charming, don’t let it get negative or obsessive or overly sexual.</p><p>This is the best way of getting people to like you, not just girls. It just so happens that it works so well that girls will want to spend more and more time with you when you do it.</p><p>If you can master this, you’ll be getting so much female attention that you won’t know what to do with it all.</p>
