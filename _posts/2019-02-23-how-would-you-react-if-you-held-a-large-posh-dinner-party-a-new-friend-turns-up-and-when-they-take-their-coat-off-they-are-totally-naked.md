title: How would you react if you held a large posh dinner party, a new friend turns up and when they take their coat off they are totally naked?

<p>If I were throwing a party with all of my friends, and someone decides to get naked, then a few people would get embarrassed, but most everyone else wouldn’t even blink. Smiles would erupt, hey, something interesting is happening. The new friend would be the center of attention for a small group as obviously this person wants it. If they want more attention, more of my friends would stop what they’re doing and watch.</p><p>At some point the fact that there’s a naked person amongst all the clothed people will stop being weird and everyone will just start chatting and having fun again.</p><p>In some circles I used to run in, casual social nudity wasn’t at all out of the ordinary. It adds a fun energy to the mix, especially if they’re attractive.</p>
