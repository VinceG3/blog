<p>Make the decision to either keep her in your life or cut her out. We can’t make that decision for you.</p><p>I will tell you that female friends are really nice things to have. At some point, hopefully, you won’t have this constant raging boner all the time demanding you have sex with every woman you’re attracted to. Once you can learn to relax, you’ll start actually valuing <i>friendship.</i> I know it’s hard to imagine now, but there is life past getting laid.</p><p>But it’s totally up to you.</p>
