<p>He's God. He's serious about you whether you want it or not. It's up to you whether you're serious about him. Being serious about God opens you up to direct intervention, but doesn't guarantee it. If your criteria for godly seriousness is divine intervention, you won't last long in the godly realm.</p><p>Bring belief to the table. It's table stakes for a charmed life.</p>
