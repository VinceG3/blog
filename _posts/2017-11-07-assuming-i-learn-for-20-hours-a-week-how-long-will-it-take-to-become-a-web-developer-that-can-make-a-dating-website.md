title: Assuming I learn for 20 hours a week, how long will it take to become a web developer that can make a dating website?

<p>You can make a dating website, with no prior experience coding, as a weekend project. Turning it into an actual business that actual people actually use and pay you actual money for the privilege, requires way more than <i>just</i> code.</p><p>I don’t know what plan of action you had in mind, but the mindset that generated this question is not the mindset that actually builds viable startups. If you had <i>that</i> mindset, then you’d already be well on your way to learning how to code and make websites. You wouldn’t be looking for info that you think you need <i>before you ever even start</i>.</p><p>Don’t ask how to become a web developer. Voraciously consume every bit of information you can find about web development and start <i>right effing now</i> on your dating website, and don’t stop until you sell to Yahoo! for a billion dollars.</p>
