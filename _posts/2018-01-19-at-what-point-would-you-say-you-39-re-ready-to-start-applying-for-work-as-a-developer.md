<p>You’re thinking about this wrong. You should be applying to development jobs if you want a job as a developer. Doesn’t matter if you have any experience or not. Many companies are still willing to take chances on inexperienced devs. You just have to find them and let them put you to work. Let them tell you you aren’t cut out for their job. You have no way of knowing.</p><p>There’s also a large ecosystem of roles that are ‘lesser’ than mainline dev work, such as testing or QA. These jobs are great entries into the industry. You should be looking for one of these as well as ‘normal’ dev roles.</p>
