title: If it is all part of God&#39;s perfect plan, is there any such thing as free will?

<p>God is perfect. His plan isn’t.</p><p>Why can’t God’s plan be perfect even if He’s perfect? Simple, because His plan involves humans, and humans aren’t perfect. God wants us to be powerful stewards and wielders of power. He wants us to get out of our own way and create on our own terms. God doesn’t want to do the creating, He wants to see what we can create.</p><p>God could, and has been portrayed as, having taken our free will from us. He doesn’t like doing that but He will if He has to. His favorite punishment is to let people deal with the consequences of their own actions. He doesn’t always do this, sometimes He shows mercy and takes our burdens away from us.</p><p>If God wanted to do it all Himself, He wouldn’t have bothered with us.</p>
