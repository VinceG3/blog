title: Why doesn&#39;t the Lord God give us more when we want it?

<p>Several reasons. The first is that most people don’t really need more, or want more bad enough to work with God in order to get it. The kind of people that really badly want <i>more</i> aren’t the kinds of people you’d really want to be, the Donald Trumps of the world who just can’t ever be satisfied.</p><p>Second, most people’s lives are a shaky apple cart that it doesn’t take much to upset. What people <i>want</i> is rarely what they <i>need</i>. And God often can’t give people what they need until they decide that what they want is the same as what they need. If what you need is to take a good hard look at your life and reflect back on your mistakes so you don’t make them again, God giving you what you want is often just giving you room for more mistakes.</p>
