<p>I don’t understand. You have an extremely specialized proficiency in high demand, yet you want to work <b>outside</b> that specialty?</p><p>I’ll never understand why people who <b>can</b> work in software, instead choose not to. I can understand if you’re not suited for it or if you really don’t have the proficiency. But it’s a truly irrational mindset if you have the expertise but don’t want to anyway.</p><p>What, do you have a ton of money sitting in the bank so you don’t <i>need</i> a ridiculously high-paying career? Or do you have an even higher paying specialty? (pretty sure only doctors and lawyers and plumbers)</p><p>Maybe I’m not understanding the question. An H4 EAD is a <i>spouse</i> visa. Maybe you’re saying your spouse has a software engineering H1 visa and you’re just wondering what kind of jobs you can get.</p><p>Or maybe you’re trying to turn your H1B visa into an H4 EAD visa.</p><p>In either case, employers or positions or fields is not restricted for H4 EAD visas, so you can get any kind of job you want under one of those visas. <a href="https://www.immihelp.com/h4-visa-ead/" data-qt-tooltip="immihelp.com">link here</a>. Look towards the bottom.</p><p>I recommend you start a business.</p>
