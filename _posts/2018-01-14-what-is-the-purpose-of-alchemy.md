<p>Alchemy is a Western meditative practice akin to chakra exploration. I rate it as no more and no less ‘valid’ than chakra work. Good for getting your feet wet and learning to appreciate the subtleties of inner mental states. But not quite at the level of the Law of Attraction or Intention / Manifestation.</p><p>The latter two have you actually affect the world through your actions and will. Alchemy / Chakras, when done properly, allow you to gently find an inner equilibrium and can serve as an excellent jumping off point for more ‘serious’ spiritual practice.</p><p>I could scour Amazon for a ‘decent’ alchemy book to start with, but honestly you can do this yourself. Just go to a bookstore or library, and start looking through the books that interest you. One of them will reach out and ‘grab’ you. That’s the one you want.</p><p>When I was younger we didn’t have this magical Internet thing to tell us the ‘right’ way to do things. You just had to make do with your intuition and, if you were lucky, a local teacher. I had both, and I have to say, one’s own intuition is the best possible guide.</p>
