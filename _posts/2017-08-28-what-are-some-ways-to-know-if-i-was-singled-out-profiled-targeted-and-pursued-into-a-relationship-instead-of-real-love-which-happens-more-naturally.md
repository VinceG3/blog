title: What are some ways to know if I was singled out, profiled, targeted and pursued into a relationship instead of real love, which happens more naturally?

<p>I’m not saying that this sort of thing never happens, it does. But it’s pretty rare. It is not an easy thing to do, manipulating people like that. So would-be predators that want to make their lives out of that sort of thing tend to gravitate towards specific types of people who they feel would be easily manipulated.</p><p>So if it’s happened to you once, then it might well happen to you more than once. And if it’s never happened, it probably won’t ever, you just won’t appear on these peoples’ radars.</p><p>Something tells me the person who asked this question is a guy, asking about being targeted by females. I think it’s easy for a guy to think of girls doing this sort of thing, because this sort of ‘predatory’ way of accomplishing your goals systematically comes naturally to men.</p><p>I’m not saying that women can’t or never would think this methodically, just that it’s really rare. But what’s not rare is the imaginings of guys thinking that women are this coldly calculating. Most of them are not. And the ones that are find better targets for those instincts than trapping men into relationships.</p>
