title: This girl asked me if I like the dress that she bought, and I answered her honestly and said, &quot;I personally don&#39;t like it, but if you like it that is all that matters. Don&#39;t worry about what I think&quot;. Do you think it was cruel what I said?

<p>You want to give better feedback than “I didn’t like the dress.” What about the dress didn’t you like? The colors, the fit, the materials? If you just say you didn’t like it, she’s likely to think you’re just trying to cut her down.</p>
