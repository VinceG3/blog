title: Why can no one understand what God really is as I do?

<p>God is all things to all people. He can exist and not exist <i>at the same time</i>. He can be vengeful and full of wrath, and gentle and full of grace. He is Father, Son, and that weird bastardization they call the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Just because you have a conception of God that is true, and it is, doesn’t mean that other people’s conceptions of God <i>aren’t also true</i>. That’s the beauty of God.</p>
