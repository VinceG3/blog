<p>Real love is reciprocated. If your therapist does not return it, then it’s not real. Your therapist probably has a lot of barriers around romantic interaction with their patients. They also have lots of tricks and techniques they use for redirecting romantic energy back into the therapeutic relationship, at least they will if they’re good therapists.</p><p>Infatuation is a one-way street, so naturally you can feel real infatuation towards your therapist. But it will stay that way until and unless they return it.</p><p>Fish where the fish are biting, my friend.</p>
