Just because other people have a different way of life doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy and agree with and believe that yours is the best.</p><p>When your neighbor says his daughter is the best daughter in the whole world, do you get into a fistfight with him because no, it’s <i>your</i> daughter that’s the best in the whole world?</p><p>Atheists take the silliest parts of faith seriously, and the most serious parts of faith as silly.</p>
