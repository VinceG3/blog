<p>Good lord. Why are you studying software engineering if you don’t want to get a job? That’s practically the only thing you can do with that skill set. I hope you aren’t taking on loans to get this education that you don’t need or want.</p><p>You have to get money from somewhere. A job is the simplest, most straightforward way of getting there. What a lot of people do in your situation, what I will probably do in mine, is to use your excess funds to invest. It’s expensive and takes a long time to do properly, but eventually you will be able to replace your income with your investment activities.</p><p>Then quit your job.</p>
