<p>I’m not sure why you’re asking the question, but you can do some basic reasoning to approximate an answer. Take the average number of times people get married in life, multiply it by the number of people in the world, divide it by the average life expectancy in years.</p><p>You can refine the estimate by gathering more data. For example, marriage rates seems to be the most variable point, so you could go collecting stats by country. Or life expectancy.</p><p>At some point, further refinement isn’t going to drive meaningful differences in your answer, and at that point you can call your estimate ‘good enough’.</p><p>I’ll leave the actual data collection and calculation to you as an exercise.</p>
