<p>Selfish people do not really care about your desires, wishes or needs.</p><p>Toxic people turn your desires, wishes, and needs around to serve their needs. They can’t help but make drama for others.</p><p>Most everyone is selfish from time to time. It’s hard to really keep everyone else’s needs in mind all the time. I’d have a hard time thinking someone who was truly toxic would actually have the self-awareness to ask about it on Quora.</p><p>But my advice would not change either way. The answer is to listen to your friends. Listening means not jumping in, it means not assuming you know. It means allowing them the space to express themselves to you.</p>
