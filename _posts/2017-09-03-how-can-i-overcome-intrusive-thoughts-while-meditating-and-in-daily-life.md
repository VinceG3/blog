<p>You don’t. Make a mental note of them, wait for them to subside, then keep on meditating.</p><p>Learn to see intrusive thoughts as part of the experience of meditating. As you keep doing it, they’ll arise less and less. You’re literally reprogramming your brain when you meditate, it takes a little while.</p><p>Eventually you’ll start to recognize intrusive thoughts as communications from your subconscious. Obviously not at first, since there will be so many of them. But eventually your brain will quiet down and only interrupt your sessions when it thinks it’s really important.</p>
