title: Feminists often point out that women have the right to be promiscuous. They&#39;re right, but do they forget that men have the right to be not attracted to it?

<p>This question is itself anti-feminist in that it demands that women alter their behavior to suit what men find attractive. But they’re not just asking them to alter their behavior for all men, they’re asking them to alter their behavior <i>specifically for men with traditional sexual values.</i> Not all men are put off by promiscuity or see promiscuity the same way.</p>
