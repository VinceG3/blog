<p>Don’t let anyone, particularly someone who neither family nor friend, run your life for you. That would be putting someone else’s wishes above your life. You built that life for yourself, including the friends you chose, and nobody has the right to take that away from you.</p><p>You should not let even your own family overrule you. Listen to them, try to understand their points of view, but at the end of the day it’s your decision that you’re making for your reasons.</p><p>You may want to try to understand your friend’s dad’s point of view, but he is another person in another family in another part of your country.</p><p>Ignore him.</p>
