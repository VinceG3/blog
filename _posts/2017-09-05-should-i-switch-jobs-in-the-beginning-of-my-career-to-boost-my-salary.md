<p>It’s not the worst idea in the world.</p><p>Work six months at your position then start interviewing. You don’t have to go too nuts, keep it to an interview a week. Unless you’re some highly sought after commodity like a Harvard grad, it’s just not going to really be worth trying to drum up a bidding war over your talents.</p><p>If you think you’re being severely underpaid, to the tune of $20k a year or more, then you don’t have to hold yourself to 6 months. It’s extremely difficult to get to market rates with a lot of companies. Just start interviewing and see where you land.</p><p>But if it’s your very first job in your field, wait 6 months to a year. It’s called paying your dues and allays fears that you’re just going to bounce after a few weeks / months. You need to get established before you start gunning for the big bucks.</p>
