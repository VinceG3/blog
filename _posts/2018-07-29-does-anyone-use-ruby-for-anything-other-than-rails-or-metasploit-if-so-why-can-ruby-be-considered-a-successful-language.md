title: Does anyone use Ruby for anything other than Rails or Metasploit? If so, why? Can Ruby be considered a successful language?

<p>There’s SonicPi, which is a programmable DAW.</p><p>I personally use Ruby for anything I can use it for. It’s the first thing I reach for when I want to write any kind of script. It’s constantly surprising me with just how useful it is for quick and dirty tasks. “Real” programmers pooh-pooh the “scripting” languages, I think they all nurture a hidden fervent wish that the glory days of 70s structured programming are going to come roaring back and their skill sets are going to make them all rich like Bill Gates.</p><p>But ask yourself what is meant by “successful,” and why it’s important to you that you know whether Ruby has it, and why the existence of Rails all by itself doesn’t make Ruby relevant enough for you to give it that label.</p><p>Is PHP successful? People only ever use it to make websites too.</p>
