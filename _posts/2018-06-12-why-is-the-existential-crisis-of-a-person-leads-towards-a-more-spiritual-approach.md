<p>Because while spirituality might not answer existential questions conclusively enough for positivists, it’s good enough such that a person can keep going without needing more.</p><p>Not knowing who you are and why you exist can be a very, very painful mental condition to be in. Any answer to that question is better than no answer. And the materialist answer boils down in many people’s minds as no answer.</p><p>So once you’ve rejected materialism, spirituality is the only way forward.</p>
