title: What do you think would happen if a neurotypical was rewired with the brain structure of a psychopath or sociopath?

<p>If you’re enlightened, then you can recede the empathic part of your mind to the background and start to have psychopathic thought processing. It’s all just neurons in your brain firing against other neurons. The ego part of your brain holds on to the idea of being a good, empathic person. You can progressively let this go through meditation or other spiritual techniques. I wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p>Psychopathy was the rule, still is in many animals. Catch a bear after he’s eaten and he might be your friend. Catch the same bear right after he woke up from hibernating and is extremely hungry, hope you have a good bear spray. Empathy runs on top of the brain and affects our conscious thought processing, but that deeper, primeval part of the brain that really doesn’t care about your fellows is still there just waiting for conscious expression.</p>
