title: Do you believe DBS Krillin could defeat Namek Saga Freeza? If so, why&#47;why not?

<p>Krillin wouldn’t even break a sweat. Easiest justification would be how the other Z warriors kicked the crap out of the Ginyu force when they touch down on King Kai’s planet. Training is given a lot of weight in the Dragonball world and every story arc has the Z warriors completely surpassing their former selves. I would not be surprised at all if friggen Chaiotsu could beat Namek Freeza by the time of the events of Super.</p><p>Have a look at Seth the Programmer’s vids. He dives into these questions far better than anyone else:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SethTheProgrammer" data-qt-tooltip="youtube.com">SethTheProgrammer</a></p>
