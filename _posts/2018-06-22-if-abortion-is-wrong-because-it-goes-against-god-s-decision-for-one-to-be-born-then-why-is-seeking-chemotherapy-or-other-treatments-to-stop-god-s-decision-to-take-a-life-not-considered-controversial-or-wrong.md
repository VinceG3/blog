title: If abortion is wrong because it goes against God’s decision for one to be born, then why is seeking chemotherapy or other treatments to stop God’s decision to take a life not considered controversial or wrong?

<p>You can’t make a solid case for God having chosen for everyone to be born. Many many children are stillborn for no moral failure on the part of the mother. God doesn’t fuck around, if He intended for every baby to be born, He would have made stillbirths impossible.</p><p>The broader point here is you just can’t make blanket statements about what God wants. The problem really isn’t with God, it’s with our understanding and ability to know. When someone is born or someone dies, you can’t put that at the feet of God, just because it happened. Similarly, any time you take an action, you can’t call that going against the will of God.</p>
