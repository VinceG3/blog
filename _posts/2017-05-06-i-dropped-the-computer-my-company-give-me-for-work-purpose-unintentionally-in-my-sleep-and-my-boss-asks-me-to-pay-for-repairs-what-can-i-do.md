<p>Ordinarily, I’d say absolutely, you should pay.</p><p>But there’s a problem here, that the repairs cost four times more than your monthly salary. That’s patently ridiculous, and the company bears a lot of responsibility here. If it were just peanuts, then whatever. But it’s not.</p><p>You should not feel responsible to pay here. Refuse to pay and let them fire you. They probably won’t because they’re getting far more value out of you than they are paying you.</p><p>But let this be a lesson to you to be more careful in the future, and I’m not talking about expensive equipment. I would absolutely never take on liability for something that costs that much. I take home roughly $5k a month. If a company told me to pay them $10k for something I broke I’d tell them to take a hike. They’re supposed to keep insurance for stuff like that.</p><p>The only way I’d pay up is if I needed the job so badly that it’s worth taking the hit just to keep the job. If that’s the case you really should have been more careful.</p>
