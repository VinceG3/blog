<p>A fit male physique is seen as attractive mostly by other guys.</p><p>The biggest trend these days in male attractiveness is “dad bod.” Once upon a time, you did sports or whatever when you were younger, but now you’ve got more important things to worry about, so you’re a bit chubbier. You know how to keep it in line, though, so you’re not full-on fat. You look like a dad, and dads are sexy.</p><p>Most of the really attractive women I’ve met seriously distrust overly fit or muscular men. Wanting to stand out from other guys in such a fashion is seen as a potential red flag pointing to immaturity.</p>
