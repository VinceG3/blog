title: Why do many theologians believe that God can&#39;t obliterate a soul? Can you name any Bible quotes that explicitly state that even God can&#39;t destroy a soul?

<p>I was actually thinking about this today. So everything in the universe can be boiled down to information. And you can’t really obliterate information. If your soul could be encoded as some kind of absolute number, then there’s no way the soul can be destroyed any more than you could wipe out the number 1.</p><p>As such, God could choose not to incarnate that soul again into a body where it could exist, but not destroy it. Because the soul is not physical in nature.</p><p>Think about it, where does God get souls? What distinguishes us from each other? I think of a giant mathematical jewel that got broken apart into a vast number of individual pieces, each many-dimensional. As each piece grows, it slowly comes to acquire Godliness and it joins God. When all the souls finish developing and joins God, God turns himself back into a jewel and breaks apart again into a new universe.</p><p>Just a theory. For God to destroy a soul, he would be destroying a piece of himself. This is supported by scripture, which states that the spirit God breathed into Adam was part of God.</p>
