title: What is the difference between romantic chemistry and friendship chemistry?

<p>The difference is whether you <b>both</b> want to get penises involved in the festivities at some point. Or vaginas, if it’s two ladies.</p><p>If one person wants to get freaky and the other person doesn’t, that’s by definition not chemistry. If neither person wants to smash uglies with the other, that’s friendly chemistry.</p><p>I’m lucky enough to have a really good lady friend where there’s <i>no romantic tension whatsoever</i>. It’s the best. Most of my female friends, there’s at least a little sexual tension. That’s fine, I wouldn’t want to change that with those friends and I know how to handle it. But this one friend we could just talk hours and hours and there’s no furtive looks like, “man I wish we were both single.”</p><p>Just fun, interesting discussions. That’s what non-romantic chemistry looks like.</p>
