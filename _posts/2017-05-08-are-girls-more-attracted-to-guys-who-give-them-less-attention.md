<p>I like <a href="/profile/User-13010684735035320447">User-13010684735035320447</a>‘s answer, I want to add on my perspective. Most of the really attractive girls I know are abso-figuratively <i>drowning</i> in male attention. For whatever reason, they have a tough time drawing really good boundaries in their life.</p><p>If you’re dealing with a girl that already has a ton of attention, giving her more of it is not going to make you stand out. You need to be finding ways to get her to give <i>you</i> attention.</p>
