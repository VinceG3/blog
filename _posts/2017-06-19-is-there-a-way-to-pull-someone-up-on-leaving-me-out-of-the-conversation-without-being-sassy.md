<p>Walk up to her and ask her if there’s something wrong with you. Be low-key about it. Don’t assume she’s doing it out of malice. It could be subconscious, you might remind her of a childhood bully or something.</p><p>She might also be attracted to you and is just shy. If it’s that then she’ll likely be effusively sorry about it. If you’re attracted to her then you might try striking up a friendly conversation with her and seeing if she bites.</p><p>If she doesn’t then all that’s left is a subconscious fear or phobia or whatever.</p>
