<p>It’s all just a matter of perspective. Spirituality operates on belief, which is created by perception of beauty. These are all things which can be studied and understood, but also experienced directly. Whether you choose to keep spirituality at arm’s length or embrace it in your life, makes no difference.</p><p>The only thing necessary is to satisfy your own yearning for beauty and inner pleasure.</p>
