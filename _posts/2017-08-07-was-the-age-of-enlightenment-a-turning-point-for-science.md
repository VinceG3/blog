<p>No. The turning point in science had to happen before the Age of Enlightenment became possible.</p><p>The way science works is that individual scientists do vast amounts of research that nobody else knows about. In order for the world to know about them, they have to publish their works. It’s not until many years after they publish their works that the general public can figure out what to do about those findings.</p><p>Science had to replace religion in the minds of the intelligentsia before they could start crafting philosophy and politics around it.</p><p>What’s funny about it is that the scientific revolution could only happen through the dedicated efforts of clergymen, who were the first scientists. Somebody had to fund them, ordinary political leadership of the time way way more important things on their plates than the movements of celestial bodies.</p><p>All over the world, the people who discovered the truths of the universe were the people now being looked at as the least rational, least scientific.</p>
