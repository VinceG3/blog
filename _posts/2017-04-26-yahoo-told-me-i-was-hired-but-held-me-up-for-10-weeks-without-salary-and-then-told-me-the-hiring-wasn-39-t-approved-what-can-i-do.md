<p>Don’t apply for these big companies. Their work culture can get really toxic.</p><p>What did you want from Yahoo? They were up front about the need for Marissa’s approval. You should not have stopped your job search because <i>you didn’t have a job yet</i>. You had a vague promise of a job.</p><p>You should have gone out and gotten a real job offer. You could have even used your pending offer as leverage to get other companies to move you through the pipe faster. Instead you sat on your hands and needlessly trusted a large company to take care of you. But large companies don’t get that way by taking care of you, they get there by having people like you take care of them.</p><p>Take your lesson and move on.</p>
