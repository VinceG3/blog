<p>No.</p><p>Identity is a weird concept, one I’ve meditated a lot on. You add and subtract things to a person’s or thing’s identity. My consciousness is one part of my identity. So is my car, my memories, and my girlfriend.</p><p>None of these things <i>are</i> me, they are all but a <i>part</i> of me. My self is a promiscuous little twat that puts its delicate little fingers on everything it touches and sees.</p><p>If I wanted to, I could start to strictly bound my identity by bringing greater awareness to it. The computer I’m typing this on is my work computer, it’s not quite as strongly mine as my personal computer but I’m still in <i>possession</i> of it and can <i>control</i> it. I just can’t take it with me when I leave the company. Whereas my personal computer is mine forever.</p><p>Do you control your consciousness?</p>
