title: What makes Christianity a monotheistic religion?

<p>Because it came out of Judaism and its first adherents were Jews. Jews all but invented monotheism with its conception of <i>ethical monotheism</i>, which holds that all morality emanates from God.</p><p>This is a much bigger deal than it looks like on paper. The other great monotheistic religion, Zoroastrianism, wasnâ€™t really monotheistic in the sense we think. Ahura Mazda was not considered to be the only god in the world, nor to have been the Creator.</p><p>There are lots of different conceptions of morality and you can think about an abstract morality, like the Golden Rule. The Jewish claim of ethical monotheism meant that Yahweh <i>created</i> morality, that the whole concept was his. Not only did God create the world, He also created abstract concepts that He then charged His people with obeying. Further Abrahamic religions riff off of the idea.</p>
