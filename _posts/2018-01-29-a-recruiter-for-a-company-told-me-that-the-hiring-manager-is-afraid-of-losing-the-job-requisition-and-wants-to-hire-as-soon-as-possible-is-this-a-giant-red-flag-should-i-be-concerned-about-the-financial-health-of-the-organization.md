title: A recruiter for a company told me that the hiring manager is afraid of losing the job requisition and wants to hire as soon as possible. Is this a giant red flag? Should I be concerned about the financial health of the organization?

<p>Not a giant red flag concerning the organization, instead a yellow flag indicating that you probably shouldn’t trust your recruiter, who obviously feels that employing pressure tactics is okay. He’ll probably do anything to get you to take the job, including misrepresent communication between you and the company.</p><p>Don’t work with that guy.</p>
