<p>Astray how, exactly? Theists benefit from culture, tradition, values, that were created for them that they <i>believe</i> in. They can easily find purpose in whatever they do.</p><p>Atheists struggle with exactly those things. Instead, it seems many of them find meaning in fighting theism. Theists see atheists as rebellious teenagers.</p>
