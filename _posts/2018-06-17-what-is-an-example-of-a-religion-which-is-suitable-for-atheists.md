<p>Atheists need no other religion, theyâ€™re already quite happy with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">magisteria</a> they have. Maybe some of the more mystically inclined will flirt with Buddhism, particularly Zen, as the surface dogmas of both seem quite compatible.</p>
