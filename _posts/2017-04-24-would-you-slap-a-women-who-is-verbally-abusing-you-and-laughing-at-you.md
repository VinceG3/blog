<p>No. I have way more inventive means at my disposal. I could be a mouthy little shit when I was a kid. If I felt she deserved it, I could pick out a few things I could sense she’s really insecure about, and when the time was right, nail her ass to the wall. She’d slap me before I’d ever lay a finger on anyone. And if she did that I’d probably laugh at her, make a few more snide remarks, then take my leave.</p><p>The reason I’m able to do this is because I have an extremely thick skin and nothing anybody could ever say to me could ever really get to me. I’d sit there and wonder what she’s doing and why she’s doing it. It would feel like a dog nipping at a bear. Annoying, but it’s not like the dog is any kind of a threat.</p><p>I’d smack her back, verbally, and it would be just like the dog got hit by the bear. It would knock the wind out of her and she won’t be able to hit back anymore.</p>
