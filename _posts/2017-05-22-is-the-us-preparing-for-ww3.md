<p>We are <i>planning</i> for WW3. That should come as no surprise. If war plans didn’t already exist for various total war scenarios then we should be firing our generals.</p><p>What we’re not doing is <i>preparing</i> for these conflicts. Preparing for WW3 is a titanic undertaking involving the reorganization of the entire economy from a peacetime footing to a wartime one. Instead of goods and services, we’d be producing guns and bombs.</p><p>The plans can only really take us from the time where hostilities ensue to the time in which we have new wartime realities to strategize around. So as soon as they’re executed, the whole military apparatus will be engaged in coming up with new strategy.</p>
