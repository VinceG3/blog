<p>I wouldn’t want to try without it.</p><p>Spirituality is greatly helped by a connection with your subconscious. This is why a lot of people study and record their dreams. It’s a way of exploring yourself.</p><p>Meditation is similar. Imagine your mind is a canvas. Normally it’s quite messy, with your studies, relationship woes, job stuff all competing for the same attention space in your head. Meditation clears the canvas and allows you to paint what you want on it, if only for a little while.</p><p>Spirituality without religion means you have to come up with your own beliefs. Beliefs don’t just come out of nowhere. You need to find out what works for you. When you clear the canvas, whatever you paint on it next is a good indicator as to what beliefs will work for you. Would you work well with a goddess, or do you just want to deal with an abstract “Source” entity for a deity? Meditation helps you find all this out.</p>
