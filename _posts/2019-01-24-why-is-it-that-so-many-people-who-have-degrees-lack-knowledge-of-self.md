title: Why is it that so many people who have degrees lack knowledge of self?

<p>Because college can only ever really teach academic knowledge. And the mindset behind acquiring academic knowledge is not the same as that needed to learn about the self.</p><p>Particularly if theyâ€™re in the so-called STEM fields, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, these fields teach a way of thinking that greatly encourages removing the self from the picture entirely. Self only complicates things when it comes to pursuing these disciplines.</p>
