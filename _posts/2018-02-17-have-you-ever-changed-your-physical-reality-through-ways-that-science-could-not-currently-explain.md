<p>I did what I thought was telekinesis once.</p><p>I was in a phase of exploring “psychic powers.” Mostly this involved learning how to attune to subconscious cuing. Experienced plenty of things that don’t really jibe with materialism, but telekinesis blew my mind at first.</p><p>It wasn’t anything fancy. I was directed to “push energy” into my laptop, which had stuck keys, and the keys became unstuck for a short period of time. I tried it a couple more times and it worked, but not as well the subsequent times. If I’d cared enough I could have conceivably kept up with it and gotten better.</p><p>What kept me from doing that was the realization that I could spend a lot less time just doing things the ordinary way. The experience was unique and unmistakable and unrepeatable, like just about every other such experience. I assume that had I kept up with it, all of my TK feats would be similarly unrepeatable. But I want repeatable powers. Those you only get by actually following the rules of physics.</p><p>Technology is way better than magic.</p>
