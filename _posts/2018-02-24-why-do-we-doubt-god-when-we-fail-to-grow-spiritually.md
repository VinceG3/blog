title: Why do we doubt God when we fail to grow spiritually?

<p>Because you’re doing it wrong. Growing spiritually is when you expand to become more Godlike. God doesn’t do it to you, you do it to yourself. All God can do is lead you to water. You’re the one that has to drink.</p><p>You may be confusing spiritual growth with something that’s easy.</p>
