<p>Listening to music can be a meditative experience for me, but if I’m looking for the “meditation experience,” I seek sensory deprivation rather than stimulation. When I get overly bored I like to find somewhere really dark and quiet and just be one with the void. Without any external stimulation to fixate on, my mind can loosen its grip a bit and lubricate.</p><p>White noise or binaural beats or any other kind of noise, eh, I can take it or leave it. I prefer a nice dark closet.</p>
