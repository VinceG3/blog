<p>Humans possess consciousness for the same reason all mammals possess consciousness. Our brains evolved specific structures that create the functions that we associate with it. Those brain structures all emerged at the same time as other features we associate with mammals.</p><p>If you want to know what separates us from other apes, that is, in a nutshell, language. There are two small parts of the brain that facilitate language. Much much much less of a drastic change in brain function than what separates mammals from birds and reptiles.</p><p>Language punches above its weight when it comes to evolutionary fitness.</p>
