<p>You realize that happiness is a red herring and learn how to find <i>meaning</i> in life. Look for something that you think is worth doing that’s not outside of your immediate ability. Make it nice and challenging. Work at it until you succeed. That success will feel nice.</p><p>Set another goal, something a bit more ambitious. Accomplish that. The only thing that matters here is that you <b>can</b> do what you’re setting out to do, but also that it’s <b>challenging</b>. Going to the store to pick up some ice cream is not challenging, so it’s not meaningful. Suddenly getting a job on Wall Street is not really possible, so it’s not meaningful.</p><p>Instead of focusing on being happy, do meaningful things. What’s meaningful is up to you, so long as it meets those two requirements then you’re golden.</p><p>Keep doing things that love to do and that you find challenging and eventually the sex and money will come. Unless of course, you don’t want them, then you can refuse the sex and give the money away. Plenty of people are uncomfortable with money, they just give everything over a certain amount to charity.</p><p>Happiness comes and goes, but a meaningful existence is realistic and achievable.</p>
