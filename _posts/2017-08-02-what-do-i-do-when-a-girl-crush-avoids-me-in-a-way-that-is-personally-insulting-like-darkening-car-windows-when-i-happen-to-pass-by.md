title: What do I do when a (girl) crush avoids me in a way that is personally insulting, like darkening car windows when I happen to pass by?

<p>Leave her the hell alone. I don’t understand why this is so hard for guys to understand. If a girl does not want to interact with you, you have <i>no right to interact with her</i>. Full stop, go find something else to do.</p><p>You’ve managed to creep her out to the point where she is <b>actively</b> trying to avoid you. You should have gotten the first dozen or so hints.</p><p>What do you want here? Do you really want her to fuck you while she’s being totally creeped out by you?</p><p>You really need to examine your intentions here. The mindset you’re expressing here is dangerously close to a rapist’s.</p>
