title: Do you have to call God “Father” or refer to God as “He” to be a Christian?

<p>I consider this to be a cultural thing and also a respect thing. Like so many things when it comes to the divine, the reason you do them isn't because God needs them from you, but because it's better for <b>you</b> to have a proper sense of humility. It helps you enter into the divine mindset more easily.</p><p>Capitalizing divine pronouns is just something that helps me to appreciate Him, and Christian culture, more.</p><p>I do not call God Father. I came to Christianity recently and so I just don't have certain habits built up. I'm not sure if it's right for me to do so, either. My relationship to God is ever-evolving so I can't rule anything out.</p>
