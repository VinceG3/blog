title: How do you feel when you lose a follower on Quora?

<p>It used to bother me. And then I realized that I drive my Quora participation, not my followers. I have never been one to cultivate and serve an audience. Rather, I serve my muse.</p><p>When I first started posting, I spent a lot of time on dating and relationships. Occasionally I’d venture into mysticism. These ventures turned into outright border raids, with downright scurrilous rants against atheism. These rants lost me a popular Quoran follower who was an atheist. I tried to keep them civil but ever since I’ve started using online social media as an outlet 15 years ago, I’ve pushed boundaries. When you push boundaries regarding people’s deeply held beliefs, they get mad.</p><p>I’ve since pulled back from the rants, well, mostly anyway, and refocused. I’m sure the people who have unfollowed me wouldn’t find my new posts quite as offensive, but at the same time, I’m not the same writer that they followed all that time ago. Someone who followed me for my dating content would really have to like me as a writer more than they liked my perspective on dating to keep following me as I dive into Christianity and comparative religion. And if they had liked me as a writer, they wouldn’t have unfollowed me over some silly rants.</p>
