<p>The problem with finding love online is that you have all the same problems you get in person, but turned up to eleven. There’s this whole aspect to the person that you never really see until you can actually link up in person. Plus you never really know what another person is getting up to, so if you’re monogamy-minded, you could be having expectations that the other doesn’t understand or could ever respect.</p><p>I’m going to say it’s possible, but as always, your mileage may vary.</p>
