<p>What do you mean by “fight for them?” Do they not want to be with you and you’re hoping that they will want to be with you because of your ‘fighting’? You can’t make someone want to be with you. You can’t fix all the problems in their life that’s keeping them from being able to love you. You can’t make their personality amenable to a relationship with you.</p><p>Love just doesn’t work that way.</p>
