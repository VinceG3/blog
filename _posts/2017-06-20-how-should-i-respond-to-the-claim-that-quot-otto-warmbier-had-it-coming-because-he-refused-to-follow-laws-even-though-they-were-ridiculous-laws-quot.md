<p>The thing about North Korea is that it does not have a functional legislature. What that means is that the law is whatever party leadership says it is. North Korea also doesn’t have a functioning judiciary. This means that what guilt and innocence is is whatever party leadership says it is. North Korea does not have a functioning press. This means that truth is whatever North Korean party leadership says it is.</p><p>The North Korean party leadership can decide you committed a crime, put you on trial, render judgment, and punish you under <i>any pretense they want</i>, because they make the laws, enforce them, and there’s nobody around to even witness what really happened, much less communicate that to anybody.</p><p>Furthermore, they have every incentive to kidnap an American every so often. They’re quite useful as diplomatic bargaining chips.</p><p>Americans should <b>never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever</b> travel to North Korea. Your chances of getting kidnapped by the North Korean state are equal to the chances that North Korea wants an American prisoner multiplied by one over however many Americans happen to be in the country at the time.</p>
