title: How many hours should I practice programming to avoid burning out?
date: 2017-05-23

<p>A2A, I have no idea. I’ve never been burned out. My roommate is a coder, he seems to get burned out all the time. I don’t really get it.</p><p>When I feel like coding, I code. When I don’t feel like coding, I don’t. I could see how if I didn’t like coding or if I never wanted to do it, how I might get burned out on it.</p><p>I waited to get a job in programming for a long time, maybe that’s why I don’t get burned out. By the time I got a job in it, coding was what I knew I wanted to spend my whole life doing.</p>
