<p>Five years is a long run. Should be plenty to make a determination as to whether you see yourself spending the rest of your life with them. My advice is to ask your gut. Does being with him feel right? Or does it feel convenient?</p><p>It’s often very hard for us to break up even when we know we need to. He may have done you a favor.</p><p>On the other hand, the week ‘off’ may have been just the thing he needed to get his priorities in order. Would kind of suck to throw away a five-year relationship because he got stressed.</p>
