<p>Spiritual awakening and enlightenment are bigger than your mental state and emotions. David Hawkins teaches that the mind is stronger than the body and the will is stronger than the mind. You can train your will to pull your mind out of depression. You can use your will to not care about the fact that you’re depressed. You can use your will to become tranquil if that’s what you want.</p><p>Enlightenment is the relinquishment of the need to do anything. Body, mind, and will find their own way to exist. “You” are reduced to an observer watching everything else happen around you. Wants, desires pop up but they don’t control you. So you could well be depressed but uninterested in pulling yourself out of it.</p>
