title: I&#39;m really bored of saying literally the same thing to God five times a day for the past 20 years. Why can&#39;t I pray in my own way?

<p>Boredom sucks all the juice out of spirituality. To find it again, you should look for beauty. Think about things that you find beautiful when praying. Perhaps a neat turn of phrase in scripture. Or a lovely place of worship. Or math. God is present in all these things. In all of everything actually.</p><p>More generally, your mind is not meant to be rigid and stuck when you are contemplating God. The words of structured prayer are intended to form a backdrop on which your mind can rest when it gets weary, not as a prison it can never escape from.</p><p>Loosen up some.</p>
