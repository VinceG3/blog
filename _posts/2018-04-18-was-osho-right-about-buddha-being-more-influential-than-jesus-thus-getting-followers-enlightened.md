<p>No, he wasn’t.</p><p>So, the way to start this off is to examine what the Buddha and Jesus were. They were both many things, but in this context we call them <i>living truth</i>. They’re physical embodiments of divinity. You Buddhists out there, don’t get hung up on the word divinity, it just means that which is beyond normal human comprehension. Since it’s beyond human comprehension, we need examples and teachers to explain it to us.</p><p>When the living truth stops living, what humanity is left with is <i>bearers</i> of truth. Christianity calls them apostles. Apostles gather the pieces of the teachings of the living truth and collect them into works of scripture. Scholars study the works of scripture and refine it. Humanity’s collective understanding of the teachings of the living truth grows over time as more people are able to learn, engage with, and embody aspects of it.</p><p>Eventually the truth gets organized into a religion, a collection of people that devote their entire lives to advancing truth they’ve received. It’s arguable as to which religion’s truths are <i>more true,</i> what’s not arguable is which religion is <i>more influential</i>. This is a mere matter of numbers.</p>
