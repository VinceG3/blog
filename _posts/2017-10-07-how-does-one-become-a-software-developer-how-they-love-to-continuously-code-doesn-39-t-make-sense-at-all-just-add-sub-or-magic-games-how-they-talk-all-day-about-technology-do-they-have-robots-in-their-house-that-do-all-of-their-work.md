title: How does one become a software developer? How they love to continuously code doesn&#39;t make sense at all (just add, sub, or magic games). How they talk all day about technology, do they have robots in their house that do all of their work?

<p>The robot’s name is Mom.</p><p>Coding is fun. It’s a bit like fishing. You load up your truck with supplies, go grab the boat, hitch it up, drive out to where you want to go fishing at, unload the boat, get everything in it, launch it, sit out on the water for hours. All for what? The feeling you get when you haul a fish in. It’s a lot of work to do to just be able to sit in nature for a while peacefully.</p><p>As for how do they get over the knowledge hump? Well, the honest answer is they get the hard parts of it done when they don’t have any responsibilities yet. If you’re just getting started coding at a late age, you have my sympathies. Because it takes a <b>lot</b> of long hours beating your head against things before it all makes sense enough.</p><p>Honestly, if you’re retraining into a new career field, the most effective path forward for you if you’re not a geek is to go to code school. They’re still there, and companies still fight over their graduates.</p>
