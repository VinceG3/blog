title: In what order do I learn web development?

<p>The easiest path forward in development is to do the hard stuff first. That way you learn the most marketable skills right off the bat.</p><p>In this case the hardest part of web dev is Javascript. Specifically, a framework like React or Angular.</p><p>Honestly though, I’d recommend even software engineering grads go to code school to learn web dev. Practically none of the things you learn in school actually prepare you for web development.</p><p>The nice thing is that nobody who hires web developers has figured out that a code school grad is just as good as a software engineering grad when it comes to pumping out working code.</p><p>So you have a much better option available to you. Just apply to web dev jobs out of school without any actual web dev knowledge. That way your future employer can foot the bill of getting you trained up. Get in with a decent company and they’ll even pay for you to go to code school.</p><p>That will free you up to just do what you want to do. Party, chase tail, maybe take on a side project or two just for the fun of it.</p><p>So long as you’re not trying to get jobs in Silicon Valley you should be fine. That place is nuts.</p>
