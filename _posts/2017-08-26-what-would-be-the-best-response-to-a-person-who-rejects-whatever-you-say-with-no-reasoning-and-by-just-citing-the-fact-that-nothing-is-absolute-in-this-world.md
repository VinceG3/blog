<p>To demonstrate something absolute. This is difficult, but not impossible.</p><p>My go-to solution for this is mathematics, in particular whole number arithmetic. 1 + 1 = 2 in every single context you can think of it in. Changing the words used to denote the concepts does not change the actual equation.</p><p>You can make this statement about most maths, but whole number arithmetic is the easiest go-to.</p>
